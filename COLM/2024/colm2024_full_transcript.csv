1463,TPD: Enhancing Student Language Model Reasoning via Principle Discovery and Guidance,Accept,Jfpb1GJUQC,,,,"[Authors]: **3. Figure 3 (a), (b) vs (c)**

For Figure 3(a) and (b), we study whether we need to have examples in the problem-solving instruction in the principle generation stage. If we do not have examples in the problem-solving instruction, it will only contain a problem-solving method. The results show that examples are very important in problem-solving instruction.
For Figure 3(c), we study the number of examples selected in the principle exploitation stage, the examples here are selected from the practice questions. We want to study the minimum number of examples required for effective learning from the principle list.

**4. It is hard to conclude that models benefit from principles deduced from errors of another model from Table 3.**

We will compare different baselines and extend Table 3 in the next version. Meanwhile, we will also visualize a comparison between principles for two LLMs for a better understanding.

**5. (Minor) The method is fairly complicated.**

Our method is designed to mimic natural human teaching and learning processes. The goal is to explore how an advanced LLM can effectively teach a weaker LLM through interaction. While the additional computational cost primarily arises from the teacher model, we anticipate that as the costs of advanced models continue to decrease, the cost of our TPD approach will become more manageable.


**6. The writing is hard to follow.**

Thanks for pointing out. We will double-check and revise the writing.

**7. Is there a specific reason behind the selection of Mixtral 8x7B–an MoE model–as the sole open-source student model?**

No, we just select it and use it. We will also add llama3-70B as a new student model in the revised version.

[Reviewer_Yx4q]: Thank you for acknowledging my comments.

- 1. I'd like to point out that the requirement of an existing large dataset is a large cost factor, which may be overlooked when applying to academic benchmarks--since they implicitly provide a large dataset with them. In novel tasks, practitioners will have to build these datasets prior to applying the proposed method. Therefore the dataset should be considered as a cost associated to this method.

- 3. I see that the explanation for Figure 3 (a) and (b) in the paper ( `numbers of examples in the problem-solving instruction`) is clear but (c) could be clarified better. I also think that establishing the names of each method/step more clearly (mentioned in Reasons to Reject 6.1.) can prevent this misunderstanding.

I will maintain my initial rating."
1463,TPD: Enhancing Student Language Model Reasoning via Principle Discovery and Guidance,Accept,mu7WMoDhdI,,,,"[Authors]: **Q2. Issues in Principle exploitation**

We would like to clarify the following points:

Principle Utilization: Our approach does not directly put the principles into the prompt. Instead, we select informative examples based on these principles, allowing the student model to learn logical coherence from these examples. TPD does not select different examples for different questions during the student model's inference. It utilizes a fixed principle list discovered during student practice to select examples from the validation set to build a fixed prompt for all instances from the same task.

Experiment Method: In our experiments, we put the selected examples into the teacher-generated instructions for all inference questions. Our goal is to build a teacher-student framework for offline settings, where the student can generally utilize the principles taught by the teacher without other help.

Principles vs. Feedback: Principles provide high-level abstract guidance, teaching the student model methods to solve one type of problem. In contrast, feedback methods offer detailed guidance for each specific question, which needs to be retrieved during the student model’s inference. TPD tests how high-level principles can help the student model and it can also be augmented with previous feedback. We will add the retrieval module to TPD and show the results in the next version. 

**Q3. Related to this: How do you pull past principles? How will you scale the method as the principle list grows?**

In our experiments, we treat principles as high-level guidance from the teacher model. The teacher model constructs a fixed prompt in TPD for all instances in a specific type of task, and we evaluate how effectively the student model learns from this prompt.

Retrieval methods, on the other hand, retrieve different feedback from past experiences, offering more fine-grained and question-specific guidance. To draw an analogy, principles are akin to what teachers impart during class, while feedback represents the past experiences encountered by the student model.

In Memprompt, the memory of past experiences expands during the inference stages. However, in TPD, we work with a fixed set of principles derived from practice questions. Although TPD currently uses a static list of principles, it can be augmented with feedback and retrieval methods. We plan to explore this enhancement in future iterations of our work.

**Q4. Missing error analysis: It would be helpful to know the kind of errors the system makes.**

We have conducted an error analysis, and the results are summarized in the following tables.
Number of Failure cases:

|         | Coin | Letter | Shuffled | Date | Navi. | GSM8K | Matrix | SVAMP |
|---------|------|--------|----------|------|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| GPT-3.5 | 0    | 0      | 1        | 2    | 1     | 3     | 1      | 2     |
| Mixtral | 0    | 0      | 0        | 0    | 1     | 4     | 2      | 2     |

Number of Principles That Do Not Improve Performance:
|         | Coin | Letter | Shuffled | Date | Navi. | GSM8K | Matrix | SVAMP |
|---------|------|--------|----------|------|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| GPT-3.5 | 0    | 0      | 0        | 1    | 0     | 2     | 0      | 2     |
| Mixtral | 0    | 0      | 0        | 0    | 0     | 1     | 0      | 2     |

The first table illustrates the number of failure cases identified. The teacher model is effective in identifying the student's failures, showing a relatively low number of failures. This highlights the necessity of using the filtering module in TPD to filter out these cases.

The second table displays the number of principles that do not improve the student model's performance. Some principles do not aid in arithmetic reasoning tasks, possibly because they are too general.

Due to the length constraints, we will include a detailed error analysis section, including a comprehensive breakdown of the types of errors and their causes, to offer a clearer picture in the revised paper.

[Authors]: **Q5. Missing Related work and Baselines**

We appreciate your highlighting the importance of comparing our work with previous studies. We acknowledge that there has been significant past work on leveraging model answers to create a memory or list of knowledge, as well as feedback mechanisms and principles. Specifically, CLIN [5] focuses on retrieving successful trials from history, MemPrompt [4] retrieves the most similar questions with user feedback in the history, and Reflexion [2] uses summaries of previous failures. LEAP [1], the most closely related work, summarizes high-level and low-level principles from the model’s previous mistakes.

Comparison with LEAP [1].
LEAP [1] and our approach share similarities in that both aim to discover principles from previous mistakes. However, there are two main differences between our methods:

1. Framework Application: We apply principle discovery within a teacher-student framework to enhance knowledge transfer through principles. In contrast, LEAP demonstrates that LLMs can also discover principles from their previous mistakes.

2. Application of Principles: We apply the principles through new examples from the validation set, whereas LEAP directly concatenates principles to the original prompt.

Comparison with Reflexion [2], CLIN [5], and MemPrompt [4].
These methods utilize per-example feedback. Specifically:

1. CLIN retrieves successful trials from history.
2. MemPrompt retrieves the most similar questions with user feedback in the history.
3. Reflexion utilizes summaries of previous failures.

In TPD, the student model uses task-level principles from the teacher model in an offline setting. Indeed, TPD can also be augmented by retrieval methods, as the teacher model can provide example-level feedback to the student model. We plan to include related experiments in the revised manuscript.

**Q6. Section 4.4 page 8 presents an interesting finding that the LLM diverges significantly from its previous answer if a critique or feedback is used. Is this a previously established finding / can you support this claim with any references? This looks contrary to other papers (e.g., cite: [3] page 7) so it is important to substantiate.**

[6] has discussed some findings about the self-correction capabilities of LLMs. To make this mechanism work, we need external feedback and carefully designed prompts. In our experiments, we provide the principle and ask the student model to critique the previous answer and then revise it based on the critique. We are not sure about the reason, but LLMs are sensitive to prompt formats so we may observe different behaviors when different types of prompts are being used.


**Q7. Results are not very convincing: The claim made in the paper are quite broad. However, the empirical results are not too convincing. The improvement over AutoCoT or 3-shot CoT is not significant and it is raises the question whether we can justify a more complex method like yours. It would be helpful to also have a simple baseline that takes the k-examples as demonstrations whose principles are applied in your method.**

In Figure 6 (in the appendix), we show an ablation study on whether the teacher model needs to provide problem-solving methods in the problem-solving instruction with three examples. We further conducted an experiment on 6-examples selected based on the principle list (there are 6 examples in the final prompt for the student model).

| GPT-3.5        | Coin  | Letter | Shuffled | Date | Navi. | GSM8K | Matrix | SVAMP |
|----------------|-------|--------|----------|------|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 6-examples CoT | 92.8  | 83.5   | 75.0     | 74.0 | 93.0  | 74.8  | 89.5   | 82.8  |
| TPD            | 100.0 | 89.9   | 75.0     | 76.5 | 97.5  | 75.4  | 93.5   | 82.9  |

**Q8. Other Missing details.**

In the principle exploitation stage, the teacher model modifies the original problem-solving instruction based on the principle list. During the filtering process, we exclude question-incorrect answer pairs that the teacher model cannot accurately distinguish. The true answer is not provided directly to the teacher model. Instead, we first evaluate whether the teacher model can identify errors in the student's answer and then determine if it can generate the correct answer.

While this filtering process helps ensure quality, the teacher model may occasionally provide vague principles. These instances are flagged for further review and dropped by human reviewers if necessary. At test time, as mentioned in the paper, the teacher model is not involved.

**Q9. Minor typos: typo in fig 1: promblem (I have not checked more thoroughly for spelling mistakes elsewhere)**

Thanks for pointing out. We will double-check and modify the writing in the next version.

[Reviewer_R4tU]: Dear authors, 

I needed some clarifications based on the rebuttal content you wrote (which was quite helpful, thank you):

- line 7 of algorithm 1 where `P += p` , we do not check for near-duplicates. Does it happen in practice that P has many near-duplicates? If P indeed has near-duplicates, then the selected examples might be over-represented because of the near-duplicates. What mechanism prevents from happening? Is it true that line 7 of the algorithm should really also have a call to a human: `P += p  if is_good_principle(p) else empty`. Related: what exactly is a good principle-- one that is crucial e.g., it is the cause of most erroneous examples? I am assuming there is no _weight_ given to a principle currently

- Thank you for the table on the influence of the size of the validation set on TPD’s performance. I could not find this in the paper: please include this important information in the next version.

- _Our TPD method selects examples based on the number of violations against the principle list. However, we can modify it to ensure higher coverage of the principle list, further optimizing example selection._ Yes that would help. How do you plan to include this modification-- do you plan to formulate it as an optimization problem: given N principles,  and each principle having a weight w, select k principles such that they are diverse, crucial, correct.

- for open ended tasks: _we can choose examples based on questions that are prone to violating the principles on different desirable aspects of the task._ that is good, and does it mean that these aspects essentially become principles and you will supply them manually and not discover them -- would that simplify the current setup?

[Reviewer_R4tU]: Dear authors,

Thank you for acknowledging the feedback on adding a retrieval module and augmenting with feedback; and for including an error analysis subsection. That would make the setup more scalable and robust.

- Your error analysis needs to be more thorough. E.g., you claim that ""The teacher model is effective in identifying the student's failures, showing a relatively low number of failures"" but the paper [6] that you cited and also [7] has evidence to suggest that for some reasoning tasks such as in math reasoning even larger models cannot spot a mistake (e.g, if the answer has a CoT style answer). The analysis that some principles are unhelpful is useful -- please include a more thorough version of this in the next version of your paper, clearing highlighting what kind of problem contributes to roughly what % of error with some examples of each error type.

[Reviewer_R4tU]: Thank you for the 6-examples CoT -- its avg. performance is 83 across tasks whereas TPD is 86 (with relevant confidence intervals it can be quite close). It reminds of another surprisingly strong baseline that picks 6 most related data points from the training set or the validation set (but not using principles based approach as in TPD). It would be helpful to add this baseline to the next version. 

I am wondering about one more perspective to the utility of your work: given as input training examples for a task and a broad description of the task, you can refine the prompt by generating modified problem solving instructions and automatically selecting a set of few shot demonstrations. Is that correct?

[Authors]: We appreciate the reviewers' insightful feedback. 

**Q1 Do near-duplicates happen in practice that P has many near-duplicates? what exactly is a good principle?**

Thank you for raising this question! In practice, we do not find near-duplicate principles. In TPD, we check the existing principle list P in line 5 of Algorithm 1 to prevent this issue. Intuitively, if the existing principle list P cannot address the presented error, the teacher model will formulate a new principle p for it. We agree that a good principle should cover a type of error. We acknowledge that we do not assign weights to principles at this stage. If the principle list becomes longer and longer, we can attempt to ask the teacher models to merge some principles. For example, if two principles address the problem of the same type, from different perspectives, the teacher model could merge them. 

**Q2 the influence of the size of the validation set on TPD’s performance**

Thanks for the suggestion!  Although the conference guidelines prevent us from updating the paper at this stage, we will ensure that this important information is included in the next version of the paper.

**Q3 How do you plan to include this modification-- do you plan to formulate it as an optimization problem?**

Thank you for your insightful suggestion. Yes, we plan to formulate this as an optimization problem, as you described. After constructing the principle list P, we will have the teacher model revisit it and assign a weight to each principle based on its importance to the question and its similarity to other principles. We will then define the violation score as the summation of the weights of the violated principles for an incorrect question-pair in the practice questions. Based on this, we will select k examples that cover diverse, crucial, and correct principles.

**Q4 for open ended tasks:**

For open-ended generations, there are some common important aspects, such as helpfulness and harmlessness, which we can use as predefined principles. However, these manually defined principles may not fully cover all desired aspects in the generated outputs. We may still need to discover some model-specific principles through the error summarization stage. This will depend on the specific student models, and we need to conduct empirical studies to investigate this further.

[Authors]: **Q5 Your error analysis needs to be more thorough**

We acknowledge that the teacher model is generally effective at identifying the student's failures. However, there are some complex reasoning tasks, where instances fail to detect errors, even with larger models. This observation underscores the necessity of the filtering module in TPD where we filter out undetected errors to enable the teacher model to summarize principles from the errors it can identify.

When we describe the teacher model as ""effective,"" we refer to its ability to identify a relatively low number of failures compared to its successes. However, we recognize the need for a more thorough analysis. In the next version of our paper, we will conduct further studies to categorize the types of problems contributing to errors and quantify the percentage each type represents. Additionally, we will provide examples of each error type to enhance understanding and clarity.

[Authors]: **Q6 Strong baseline that picks 6 most related data points from the training set or the validation set**

Thank you for your insightful suggestion. We agree that the baseline of retrieving the six most related data points from the training or validation set is indeed interesting. We share your curiosity about the student model’s performance with this approach. Given the limited time remaining, we will include this baseline in the next version of our paper. 

**Q7 given as input training examples for a task and a broad description of the task, you can refine the prompt by generating modified problem solving instructions and automatically selecting a set of few shot demonstrations. Is that correct?**

Yes, that is correct. With several labels for the questions (used to build practice questions), the teacher model can refine the problem-solving instructions and automatically select a set of few-shot demonstrations. While this paper primarily explores the teacher-student framework, we also envision future work where the student model could self-discover and summarize principles using the true labels from the practice questions.

[Reviewer_R4tU]: Thank you for the response. 

Ans to Q7  -- future work where the student model could self-discover and summarize principles using the true labels from the practice questions -- at that point, it becomes very close to LEAP [1] method. You can include this in the future work may be.
Ans to Q6 -- strong baseline -- yes, I would be curious to find out in your next version. 
Ans to other questions -- thank you. Your responses have given me more clarity now. I will very likely increase my score today. Obviously it would be under the assumption that the authors would include the suggested studies, analysis, baselines, and also try out the method updates (this part, if it is possible to do so). That should make the paper stronger (supporting the claims, and making the method more robust). 

*One final question*: how much human intervention (for quality checks on principles) was needed across different tasks. I am looking for a ballpark quantitative answer. Also, what instruction did you give the human on what a good principle is.

[Authors]: We appreciate your thoughtful feedback. Due to the limited time of the discussion period and conference rules, we cannot update the scripts now. However, we guarantee that we will include the suggested studies, analyses, baselines, and method updates in the next version of the paper.

Regarding human intervention for quality checks on principles, since the principle lists in our experiments are not very long, reviewers can finish checking the principle list within approximately 20 minutes per task. In TPD, human reviewers are responsible for verifying each principle in the principle list for all tasks to ensure quality. They sequentially review and remove any principles that are vague, erroneous, or confusing.

The instructions provided to human reviewers are as follows. We will also include them in the appendix in the next version.

1.The principle should be written in simple, clear language that is easy to understand.

2.The principle should be specific enough to address a particular type of error or concept.

3.The principle should be factually correct and free from errors.

4.The principle should provide actionable guidance that helps the student avoid the error in the future.

5.While specific, the principle should also be general enough to apply to similar errors or situations.

[Reviewer_R4tU]: Thank you. I increased my score accordingly."

[Authors]: **Q5. Missing Related work and Baselines**

We appreciate your highlighting the importance of comparing our work with previous studies. We acknowledge that there has been significant past work on leveraging model answers to create a memory or list of knowledge, as well as feedback mechanisms and principles. Specifically, CLIN [5] focuses on retrieving successful trials from history, MemPrompt [4] retrieves the most similar questions with user feedback in the history, and Reflexion [2] uses summaries of previous failures. LEAP [1], the most closely related work, summarizes high-level and low-level principles from the model’s previous mistakes.

Comparison with LEAP [1].
LEAP [1] and our approach share similarities in that both aim to discover principles from previous mistakes. However, there are two main differences between our methods:

1. Framework Application: We apply principle discovery within a teacher-student framework to enhance knowledge transfer through principles. In contrast, LEAP demonstrates that LLMs can also discover principles from their previous mistakes.

2. Application of Principles: We apply the principles through new examples from the validation set, whereas LEAP directly concatenates principles to the original prompt.

These methods utilize per-example feedback. Specifically:

2. MemPrompt retrieves the most similar questions with user feedback in the history.
3. Reflexion utilizes summaries of previous failures.

In TPD, the student model uses task-level principles from the teacher model in an offline setting. Indeed, TPD can also be augmented by retrieval methods, as the teacher model can provide example-level feedback to the student model. We plan to include related experiments in the revised manuscript.

**Q6. Section 4.4 page 8 presents an interesting finding that the LLM diverges significantly from its previous answer if a critique or feedback is used. Is this a previously established finding / can you support this claim with any references? This looks contrary to other papers (e.g., cite: [3] page 7) so it is important to substantiate.**

[6] has discussed some findings about the self-correction capabilities of LLMs. To make this mechanism work, we need external feedback and carefully designed prompts. In our experiments, we provide the principle and ask the student model to critique the previous answer and then revise it based on the critique. We are not sure about the reason, but LLMs are sensitive to prompt formats so we may observe different behaviors when different types of prompts are being used.


**Q7. Results are not very convincing: The claim made in the paper are quite broad. However, the empirical results are not too convincing. The improvement over AutoCoT or 3-shot CoT is not significant and it is raises the question whether we can justify a more complex method like yours. It would be helpful to also have a simple baseline that takes the k-examples as demonstrations whose principles are applied in your method.**

In Figure 6 (in the appendix), we show an ablation study on whether the teacher model needs to provide problem-solving methods in the problem-solving instruction with three examples. We further conducted an experiment on 6-examples selected based on the principle list (there are 6 examples in the final prompt for the student model).

| GPT-3.5        | Coin  | Letter | Shuffled | Date | Navi. | GSM8K | Matrix | SVAMP |
|----------------|-------|--------|----------|------|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| 6-examples CoT | 92.8  | 83.5   | 75.0     | 74.0 | 93.0  | 74.8  | 89.5   | 82.8  |
| TPD            | 100.0 | 89.9   | 75.0     | 76.5 | 97.5  | 75.4  | 93.5   | 82.9  |

**Q8. Other Missing details.**

In the principle exploitation stage, the teacher model modifies the original problem-solving instruction based on the principle list. During the filtering process, we exclude question-incorrect answer pairs that the teacher model cannot accurately distinguish. The true answer is not provided directly to the teacher model. Instead, we first evaluate whether the teacher model can identify errors in the student's answer and then determine if it can generate the correct answer.

While this filtering process helps ensure quality, the teacher model may occasionally provide vague principles. These instances are flagged for further review and dropped by human reviewers if necessary. At test time, as mentioned in the paper, the teacher model is not involved.

**Q9. Minor typos: typo in fig 1: promblem (I have not checked more thoroughly for spelling mistakes elsewhere)**

Thanks for pointing out. We will double-check and modify the writing in the next version.

[Reviewer_R4tU]: Dear authors, 

I needed some clarifications based on the rebuttal content you wrote (which was quite helpful, thank you):

- line 7 of algorithm 1 where `P += p` , we do not check for near-duplicates. Does it happen in practice that P has many near-duplicates? If P indeed has near-duplicates, then the selected examples might be over-represented because of the near-duplicates. What mechanism prevents from happening? Is it true that line 7 of the algorithm should really also have a call to a human: `P += p  if is_good_principle(p) else empty`. Related: what exactly is a good principle-- one that is crucial e.g., it is the cause of most erroneous examples? I am assuming there is no _weight_ given to a principle currently

- Thank you for the table on the influence of the size of the validation set on TPD’s performance. I could not find this in the paper: please include this important information in the next version.

- _Our TPD method selects examples based on the number of violations against the principle list. However, we can modify it to ensure higher coverage of the principle list, further optimizing example selection._ Yes that would help. How do you plan to include this modification-- do you plan to formulate it as an optimization problem: given N principles,  and each principle having a weight w, select k principles such that they are diverse, crucial, correct.

- for open ended tasks: _we can choose examples based on questions that are prone to violating the principles on different desirable aspects of the task._ that is good, and does it mean that these aspects essentially become principles and you will supply them manually and not discover them -- would that simplify the current setup?

[Reviewer_R4tU]: Dear authors,

Thank you for acknowledging the feedback on adding a retrieval module and augmenting with feedback; and for including an error analysis subsection. That would make the setup more scalable and robust.

- Your error analysis needs to be more thorough. E.g., you claim that ""The teacher model is effective in identifying the student's failures, showing a relatively low number of failures"" but the paper [6] that you cited and also [7] has evidence to suggest that for some reasoning tasks such as in math reasoning even larger models cannot spot a mistake (e.g, if the answer has a CoT style answer). The analysis that some principles are unhelpful is useful -- please include a more thorough version of this in the next version of your paper, clearing highlighting what kind of problem contributes to roughly what % of error with some examples of each error type.

[Reviewer_R4tU]: Thank you for the 6-examples CoT -- its avg. performance is 83 across tasks whereas TPD is 86 (with relevant confidence intervals it can be quite close). It reminds of another surprisingly strong baseline that picks 6 most related data points from the training set or the validation set (but not using principles based approach as in TPD). It would be helpful to add this baseline to the next version. 

I am wondering about one more perspective to the utility of your work: given as input training examples for a task and a broad description of the task, you can refine the prompt by generating modified problem solving instructions and automatically selecting a set of few shot demonstrations. Is that correct?

[Authors]: We appreciate the reviewers' insightful feedback. 

**Q1 Do near-duplicates happen in practice that P has many near-duplicates? what exactly is a good principle?**

Thank you for raising this question! In practice, we do not find near-duplicate principles. In TPD, we check the existing principle list P in line 5 of Algorithm 1 to prevent this issue. Intuitively, if the existing principle list P cannot address the presented error, the teacher model will formulate a new principle p for it. We agree that a good principle should cover a type of error. We acknowledge that we do not assign weights to principles at this stage. If the principle list becomes longer and longer, we can attempt to ask the teacher models to merge some principles. For example, if two principles address the problem of the same type, from different perspectives, the teacher model could merge them. 

**Q2 the influence of the size of the validation set on TPD’s performance**

Thanks for the suggestion!  Although the conference guidelines prevent us from updating the paper at this stage, we will ensure that this important information is included in the next version of the paper.

**Q3 How do you plan to include this modification-- do you plan to formulate it as an optimization problem?**

Thank you for your insightful suggestion. Yes, we plan to formulate this as an optimization problem, as you described. After constructing the principle list P, we will have the teacher model revisit it and assign a weight to each principle based on its importance to the question and its similarity to other principles. We will then define the violation score as the summation of the weights of the violated principles for an incorrect question-pair in the practice questions. Based on this, we will select k examples that cover diverse, crucial, and correct principles.

**Q4 for open ended tasks:**

For open-ended generations, there are some common important aspects, such as helpfulness and harmlessness, which we can use as predefined principles. However, these manually defined principles may not fully cover all desired aspects in the generated outputs. We may still need to discover some model-specific principles through the error summarization stage. This will depend on the specific student models, and we need to conduct empirical studies to investigate this further.

[Authors]: **Q5 Your error analysis needs to be more thorough**

We acknowledge that the teacher model is generally effective at identifying the student's failures. However, there are some complex reasoning tasks, where instances fail to detect errors, even with larger models. This observation underscores the necessity of the filtering module in TPD where we filter out undetected errors to enable the teacher model to summarize principles from the errors it can identify.

When we describe the teacher model as ""effective,"" we refer to its ability to identify a relatively low number of failures compared to its successes. However, we recognize the need for a more thorough analysis. In the next version of our paper, we will conduct further studies to categorize the types of problems contributing to errors and quantify the percentage each type represents. Additionally, we will provide examples of each error type to enhance understanding and clarity.

[Authors]: **Q6 Strong baseline that picks 6 most related data points from the training set or the validation set**

Thank you for your insightful suggestion. We agree that the baseline of retrieving the six most related data points from the training or validation set is indeed interesting. We share your curiosity about the student model’s performance with this approach. Given the limited time remaining, we will include this baseline in the next version of our paper. 

**Q7 given as input training examples for a task and a broad description of the task, you can refine the prompt by generating modified problem solving instructions and automatically selecting a set of few shot demonstrations. Is that correct?**

Yes, that is correct. With several labels for the questions (used to build practice questions), the teacher model can refine the problem-solving instructions and automatically select a set of few-shot demonstrations. While this paper primarily explores the teacher-student framework, we also envision future work where the student model could self-discover and summarize principles using the true labels from the practice questions.

[Reviewer_R4tU]: Thank you for the response. 

Ans to Q7  -- future work where the student model could self-discover and summarize principles using the true labels from the practice questions -- at that point, it becomes very close to LEAP [1] method. You can include this in the future work may be.
Ans to Q6 -- strong baseline -- yes, I would be curious to find out in your next version. 
Ans to other questions -- thank you. Your responses have given me more clarity now. I will very likely increase my score today. Obviously it would be under the assumption that the authors would include the suggested studies, analysis, baselines, and also try out the method updates (this part, if it is possible to do so). That should make the paper stronger (supporting the claims, and making the method more robust). 

*One final question*: how much human intervention (for quality checks on principles) was needed across different tasks. I am looking for a ballpark quantitative answer. Also, what instruction did you give the human on what a good principle is.

[Authors]: We appreciate your thoughtful feedback. Due to the limited time of the discussion period and conference rules, we cannot update the scripts now. However, we guarantee that we will include the suggested studies, analyses, baselines, and method updates in the next version of the paper.

Regarding human intervention for quality checks on principles, since the principle lists in our experiments are not very long, reviewers can finish checking the principle list within approximately 20 minutes per task. In TPD, human reviewers are responsible for verifying each principle in the principle list for all tasks to ensure quality. They sequentially review and remove any principles that are vague, erroneous, or confusing.

The instructions provided to human reviewers are as follows. We will also include them in the appendix in the next version.

1.The principle should be written in simple, clear language that is easy to understand.

2.The principle should be specific enough to address a particular type of error or concept.

3.The principle should be factually correct and free from errors.

4.The principle should provide actionable guidance that helps the student avoid the error in the future.

5.While specific, the principle should also be general enough to apply to similar errors or situations.

[Reviewer_R4tU]: Thank you. I increased my score accordingly."

[Authors]: **3. Figure 3 (a), (b) vs (c)**

For Figure 3(a) and (b), we study whether we need to have examples in the problem-solving instruction in the principle generation stage. If we do not have examples in the problem-solving instruction, it will only contain a problem-solving method. The results show that examples are very important in problem-solving instruction.
For Figure 3(c), we study the number of examples selected in the principle exploitation stage, the examples here are selected from the practice questions. We want to study the minimum number of examples required for effective learning from the principle list.

**4. It is hard to conclude that models benefit from principles deduced from errors of another model from Table 3.**

We will compare different baselines and extend Table 3 in the next version. Meanwhile, we will also visualize a comparison between principles for two LLMs for a better understanding.

**5. (Minor) The method is fairly complicated.**

Our method is designed to mimic natural human teaching and learning processes. The goal is to explore how an advanced LLM can effectively teach a weaker LLM through interaction. While the additional computational cost primarily arises from the teacher model, we anticipate that as the costs of advanced models continue to decrease, the cost of our TPD approach will become more manageable.


**6. The writing is hard to follow.**

Thanks for pointing out. We will double-check and revise the writing.

**7. Is there a specific reason behind the selection of Mixtral 8x7B–an MoE model–as the sole open-source student model?**

No, we just select it and use it. We will also add llama3-70B as a new student model in the revised version.

[Reviewer_Yx4q]: Thank you for acknowledging my comments.

- 1. I'd like to point out that the requirement of an existing large dataset is a large cost factor, which may be overlooked when applying to academic benchmarks--since they implicitly provide a large dataset with them. In novel tasks, practitioners will have to build these datasets prior to applying the proposed method. Therefore the dataset should be considered as a cost associated to this method.

- 3. I see that the explanation for Figure 3 (a) and (b) in the paper ( `numbers of examples in the problem-solving instruction`) is clear but (c) could be clarified better. I also think that establishing the names of each method/step more clearly (mentioned in Reasons to Reject 6.1.) can prevent this misunderstanding.

I will maintain my initial rating."

In conclusion, GPT3.5 based translation is doing better than Google Translation for most of the languages, however, it seems like Google Translation is also *reasonably* good. Which means, in case we do not have access to LLM based translation, commercial translation like Google Translate will also work.

[Authors]: **About Atomic breakdown and factuality evaluation in non-English language:**

Accurate evaluation of the fact verification system (using non-English atomic breakdown) in non-English language is difficult for several reasons: 
 
* The original NPM implementation (which is crucial for reaching good accuracy)  was trained on English data only and the tokenizer heavily disfavors non-English languages, which is why running the most effective method (ensembling with NPM) in non-English language is not possible [refer to the table at the very end of this comment]. Implementing non English NPM is a worthwhile objective, but out of scope from our project.
We, thus, decide to only include results for Retrieval + ChatGPT method for doing atomic fact breakdown in non-English language. [We do not provide numbers for Mistral since Mistral is English only model]

* Besides, to make a fair comparison between two languages’ factuality, while doing atomic breakdown in the corresponding language, we need to have the same ground truth corpus in both languages. 
To meet the later requirement, we translate wikipedia in the non-English language to English (as X→ EN usually leaves out less translationese than EN→X)
    * This setting is similar to Figure 4a. We sampled 10000 wikipedia articles from French and Korean wikipedia and then took the top 120 articles by length and asked GPT4 to generate biographies corresponding to those entities. We translate those 120 wikipedia articles from KOR/French into English for a comparison.

* Since we do not have ground truth labeled data for these 120 entities in French/Korean, we only show the difference with the best performing method (Retrieval + Mistral + NPM using EN wikipedia) here (like Figure 4a)


We only conducted this experiment for Korean and French (one latin and one non-latin script language)

| Language | Wiki-X-breakdown-in-X | X-wiki-translated-to-EN-breakdown-in-EN |  original-EN-wiki_breakdown-in-EN |

| Korean   | -17.36                         | -34.27                                  |-35.86                           |

The column represents the difference with the best performing method (Retrieval + (Mistral + NPM)) with the column. The method is same for all the cases (Retrieval + ChatGPT): 
* **Wiki-X-breakdown-in-X:** We used atomic breakdown in KOR/FR and also verified against the corresponding wikipedia
* **X-wiki-translated-to-EN-breakdown-in-EN:** We did atomic breakdown in English, and verified against the translated KOR/FR wikipedia, that has been translated into English
* **original-EN-wiki_breakdown-in-EN:** Atomic breakdown in English and then verified against English wikipedia

**In conclusion:**
* It is difficult to accurately quantify whether doing atomic breakdown in non-English languages will yield good results or not given the large difference with the best performing method. 
* Still, it is possible that if there is a multilingual NPM model, the accuracy would go higher. 
* A qualitative look at the atomic breakdown of biographies generated in Korean shows that the generated facts are accurate. This suggests that once we have a good multilingual NP model, our method would work well in the Korean setting.

[Reviewer_5m3n]: Thanks for your response. A few of my concerns have been addressed, but my major concern is the novelty of the method. Therefore, I will maintain my score.

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer 5m3n,

Here is the comparison with different baselines. Each column shows the difference with the ground truth (human evaluation) of each method. 

Trivial baselines:
Random prediction: 8.86%
Always ""Supported"": - 41.15%
Always ""Not Supported"": 58.86%

*NPM refers to Non Parametric Model, which requires having access to the Wikipedia article
*The final method is the ensemble version of NPM and Retrieval + Mistral and it performs the best. This is the one we used throughout our paper for other analyses.

From the table, it is clear that, in order to reach good performance, an ensembling of NPM (Non Parametric Language Modeling (Min et al ‘22) and retrieval based method is critical. Retrieval + LLM usually overestimates model’s factscores and having NPM counteracts the effect of overestimation on average (similar conclusion was also reported in the original paper). 

Similarly, in our comment to reviewer r8Mi, we discuss in length about the difficulty and impracticality of fair factuality evaluation in a monolingual setting. The translation step seems critical if we want to disentangle a fair comparison of models’ generation in different languages.

Our method, though very simple, and does not contain any novel model development, is still very effective for factuality evaluation in multilingual settings, which was our original goal."

[Reviewer_bkdk]: I like this work and think it is an incorrect topic. The authors have promised some revisions which I think are minor and easy to do.

I think the paper will make for good conversation at the conference and agree it is an understudied area.

Re: other reviewer concerns: I agree that this paper doesn't propose any new methods and the evaluation process is simple. However, I don't think that is a major blocker - simple analyses done well are important also.  

I agree with reviewer a4f9 that more models would be nice - perhaps the authors could use Together.ai (if they can't run them locally) to use some of the larger models like Llama3-70B (but of course you couldn't have put that in the paper since it wasn't out yet).  I think the authors could and probably should do this so that there are reproducible results but again this wouldn't take very long to add."

At a core level what is happening internally is that the diversity of responses from a single prompt is limited.

The table above shows the experimental results of ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) on different arithmetic tasks. As illustrated, although ChatGPT has a higher accuracy, its reliability remains low, and it lacks the ability to refuse out-of-knowledge questions. In different sub-tasks, the truthfulness of ChatGPT is generally on par with its accuracy, which indicates that it does not refuse arithmetic problems (even though we used a prudent system prompt to instruct ChatGPT to refuse questions it cannot answer). Moreover, in more challenging tasks such as multiplication, division, and problems involving 3-5 digit numbers, ChatGPT exhibits strong hallucinations, with truthfulness significantly lower than llama2+RLKF. Therefore, we do not believe that the issue of reliability can be resolved through broader generic instruction-tuning.

[Reviewer_tasN]: I appreciate the authors' additional experiments. I will summarize my original reasons for rejection, and whether they have been addressed.

1. **Re: Calibration** — the authors compare to a large number of post-hoc calibration methods, which they agree to include in the final paper. While they find that their method underperforms a majority vote approach, I agree that there are merits to reliability baked into the model. The weaker performance compared to majority vote limits their empirical claims, but is not an independent reason for rejection.
2. **The scope of experiments is too limited.** This is unaddressed. The authors evaluate on arithmetic benchmarks, one of which is synthetic. It would benefit the paper greatly to show that if reward models are trained on generic preference data using their method, it will lead to higher performance on a broad swath of tasks.
3. **Large amounts of preference data will naturally contain examples where refusal to answer is preferred to incorrect answers.** This is not directly addressed. The authors do provide results showing that `gpt-3.5-turbo` is still not-that-reliable. However, it's not clear whether this is because ""refusal > incorrect"" pairs are not present in preference data, or because they are not enough to lead to reliable behavior.
4. **The main contribution, which is about how to create preference data for the reward model, is not clear.** As far as I can tell, this concern is not addressed.
5. **Previous PPO approaches (e.g., Llama2-chat) do use model-specific reward models, contradicting what the authors claim.** As far as I can see, this concern is not addressed. The (incorrect) argument that current reward models are model-agnostic is used to motivate the authors' approach.

To summarize, the paper introduces a simple approach for training better reward models — introduce preference data where rejections are preferred to incorrect answers. There are merits to an approach to bake reliability into the model, compared to posthoc calibration methods, which the authors will add to the experiments.

However, I wish the writing were more clear about the simplicity of their approach (#4), which is an **advantage** rather than a downside. Moreover, the paper's experiments are in a relatively narrow test case, and it's not clear whether the method will be effective more generally (concern #2 and #3).

If the other reviews are willing to champion the paper, I will not argue against acceptance.

### Results on knowledge-based QA task (TriviaQA)

|method| Prec | Acc | Truth | Rely|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|llama2 + no system prompt | 60.2 | 58.9 | 61.2 | 61.1 | 
|llama2 + prudent system prompt | 53.9 |42.4 | 63.7 | 59.2|
|llama2 + rlkf | **73.5** | 50.1 |  **81.9** | **71.8** |

We further validated our method on the knowledge-based Question Answering task, i.e., TriviaQA [1]. TriviaQA is a widely-used QA dataset that can be used to test a model's world knowledge. We selected 20,000 samples from the TriviaQA training set for training. Since the ground truth of the TriviaQA test set is not publicly available, we used the TriviaQA development set, which contains 11,313 samples, to validate our results. We used the Exact Match metric (whether the answer is exactly in the model's response) from TriviaQA paper as our measure of Accuracy, while keeping the other metrics consistent with those in our paper. As shown in the table above, our method significantly improves the model's truthfulness and overall reliability on the TriviaQA dataset. This demonstrates that our method can enhance the general reliability of LLMs across different tasks, not just limited to arithmetic questions. We will include these results and more experimental details in future versions of our paper.

We further tested the reliability of GPT4-o on arithmetic datasets. We found that even GPT4-o remains unreliable and lacks the ability to reject out-of-knowledge questions. From Llama2 to ChatGPT to GPT4-o, they all use a large amount of industrial-grade generic instruction-tuning data, but they still lack good reliability. We believe that, on the one hand, these generic preference data may lack appropriate rejection data (rejecting only when the model lacks relevant knowledge, otherwise it needs to answer questions). On the other hand, the RLHF training process constructs preference pairs based on the model's own sampling results, making it difficult to generate appropriate rejection behavior during the sampling process. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to synthesize reliable preference pairs through RLKF to make the model more reliable.

## 3. Re: Comment#4

Sorry for any trouble caused by the writing. Your understanding is correct; our method does not differ from PPO during training. The key lies in how we construct preference pairs, which differs from RLHF. We construct preference pairs based on feedback from knowledge, specifically whether the model has relevant knowledge to answer the question. The core objective is to make the model more reliable, teaching it to explicitly reject when necessary, rather than improving the model's response score based on human preferences.

## 4. Re: Comment#5
We apologize for the inaccuracies in the writing of our paper. We will correct these inaccurate claims in our paper. What we meant to convey is that 1) on the one hand, existing generic preference pair data [2-4] is often fixed and lacks the ability to dynamically adjust for each model's capabilities and knowledge. For the same question, we expect the corresponding preference pair to be different for models capable of answering and those incapable. 2) on the other hand, existing LLMs such as Llama-2 initialize their reward models for RLHF from these generic preference pairs. Although subsequent optimization is based on human feedback and model sampling results, poor initialization can significantly affect the model's sampling space, making it difficult for the final model to have good reliability.

We hope the above responses can address your concerns.

[Reviewer_tasN]: 1. Thank you for the new results on TriviaQA! How did you construct the preference data for the reward model? Moreover, this only compares RLKF to using a system prompt. Do you compare RLKF to regular RLHF?

2. It remains unclear to me why examples of ""rejection > incorrect"" preferences would not naturally be present in existing methods for preference data collection. However if these preferences are sampled from the LM, I buy the authors' argument that models do not naturally know how to decline unless explicitly taught.

3. Thank you for clarifying!

4. The statement that ""*existing LLMs such as Llama-2 initialize their reward models for RLHF from these generic preference pairs*"" is untrue, to the best of my understanding. I believe the reward model is initialized using responses sampled from (variants of) Llama2 (and continuously updated using the latest iteration of the finetuned model). It is not initialized from a static dataset of preference data.

For reference, I share a snippet from the Llama 2 tech report below:
> We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose between **two sampled model responses**, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the two responses to a given prompt are sampled from **two different model variants**, and varying the temperature hyper-parameter.

[...]

> Human annotations were **collected in batches on a weekly basis**. As we collected more preference data, our reward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions for Llama 2-Chat (see the results in Section 5, Figure 20). Llama 2-Chat improvement also shifted the model’s data distribution. Since reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from hyper-specialization (Scialom et al., 2020b), **it is important before a new Llama 2-Chat tuning iteration to gather new preference data using the latest Llama 2-Chat iterations**. This step helps keep the reward model on-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model."

|rlkf|1|31.9/88.1/56.5|17.0/59.6/41.5|

|agreement(consistency)[1]|10 |37.9/79.9/62.3|20.1/77.1/44.6|

- **Unable to Reject Explicitly**: Calibration-based methods need to search and determine the best threshold for rejection and provide human-crafted rejection templates as responses. As we shown in the table, we search the threshold for arithmetic and gsm8k separately (on 100 validation cases from each dataset). However, the thresholds are quite different for different datasets which results in significant performance degradation with different thresholds.  In contrast, our method can enable the model to reject out-of-knowledge questions with personalized responses for different prompts automatically. 

- **High Inference Cost**: Consistency-based methods, on the one hand, require multiple samplings to obtain results, and on the other hand, may necessitate the use of additional models to extract answers for voting (we use ChatGPT to extract answers because rule-based methods may result in inaccurate extraction). This results in 5(sampling num) * 2(1 for answer generation, 1 for answer extraction) = 10 times (or at least 5 times) the inference cost than other methods. Some Verbalized-based methods (verb. 2S) also require the model to generate confidence through an additional round of response after generating the answer.

- **High Calibration Variance**: Utilizing calibration methods to determine the accuracy of answers is not stable. For instance, logit-based methods are not quite reasonable when the model generates longer responses, and Verbalized-based methods result in significant fluctuations in confidence scores and even prediction results (as shown in the gsm8k results of verb. methods) due to the variability in prompts.

In summary,  calibration methods are more suitable for analyzing the uncertainty of model responses or constructing training data (such as the self-consistency[5] introduced in our paper). However, our alignment research on reliability aims to enable the model to acquire self-knowledge and explicitly refuse out-of-knowledge questions. Experimental results show our method can enable the model to reject automatically without additional inference costs and improve the accuracy of rejections compared to most calibration methods.

While they find that their method underperforms a majority vote approach, I agree that there are merits to reliability baked into the model. The weaker performance compared to majority vote limits their empirical claims, but is not an independent reason for rejection.
2. **The scope of experiments is too limited.** This is unaddressed. The authors evaluate on arithmetic benchmarks, one of which is synthetic. It would benefit the paper greatly to show that if reward models are trained on generic preference data using their method, it will lead to higher performance on a broad swath of tasks.
3. **Large amounts of preference data will naturally contain examples where refusal to answer is preferred to incorrect answers.** This is not directly addressed. The authors do provide results showing that `gpt-3.5-turbo` is still not-that-reliable. However, it's not clear whether this is because ""refusal > incorrect"" pairs are not present in preference data, or because they are not enough to lead to reliable behavior.
4. **The main contribution, which is about how to create preference data for the reward model, is not clear.** As far as I can tell, this concern is not addressed.
5. **Previous PPO approaches (e.g., Llama2-chat) do use model-specific reward models, contradicting what the authors claim.** As far as I can see, this concern is not addressed. The (incorrect) argument that current reward models are model-agnostic is used to motivate the authors' approach.

To summarize, the paper introduces a simple approach for training better reward models — introduce preference data where rejections are preferred to incorrect answers. There are merits to an approach to bake reliability into the model, compared to posthoc calibration methods, which the authors will add to the experiments.

However, I wish the writing were more clear about the simplicity of their approach (#4), which is an **advantage** rather than a downside. Moreover, the paper's experiments are in a relatively narrow test case, and it's not clear whether the method will be effective more generally (concern #2 and #3).

If the other reviews are willing to champion the paper, I will not argue against acceptance.

### Results on knowledge-based QA task (TriviaQA)

|method| Prec | Acc | Truth | Rely|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|llama2 + no system prompt | 60.2 | 58.9 | 61.2 | 61.1 | 
|llama2 + prudent system prompt | 53.9 |42.4 | 63.7 | 59.2|
|llama2 + rlkf | **73.5** | 50.1 |  **81.9** | **71.8** |

We further validated our method on the knowledge-based Question Answering task, i.e., TriviaQA [1]. TriviaQA is a widely-used QA dataset that can be used to test a model's world knowledge. We selected 20,000 samples from the TriviaQA training set for training. Since the ground truth of the TriviaQA test set is not publicly available, we used the TriviaQA development set, which contains 11,313 samples, to validate our results. We used the Exact Match metric (whether the answer is exactly in the model's response) from TriviaQA paper as our measure of Accuracy, while keeping the other metrics consistent with those in our paper. As shown in the table above, our method significantly improves the model's truthfulness and overall reliability on the TriviaQA dataset. This demonstrates that our method can enhance the general reliability of LLMs across different tasks, not just limited to arithmetic questions. We will include these results and more experimental details in future versions of our paper.

We further tested the reliability of GPT4-o on arithmetic datasets. We found that even GPT4-o remains unreliable and lacks the ability to reject out-of-knowledge questions. From Llama2 to ChatGPT to GPT4-o, they all use a large amount of industrial-grade generic instruction-tuning data, but they still lack good reliability. We believe that, on the one hand, these generic preference data may lack appropriate rejection data (rejecting only when the model lacks relevant knowledge, otherwise it needs to answer questions). On the other hand, the RLHF training process constructs preference pairs based on the model's own sampling results, making it difficult to generate appropriate rejection behavior during the sampling process. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to synthesize reliable preference pairs through RLKF to make the model more reliable.

## 3. Re: Comment#4

Sorry for any trouble caused by the writing. Your understanding is correct; our method does not differ from PPO during training. The key lies in how we construct preference pairs, which differs from RLHF. We construct preference pairs based on feedback from knowledge, specifically whether the model has relevant knowledge to answer the question. The core objective is to make the model more reliable, teaching it to explicitly reject when necessary, rather than improving the model's response score based on human preferences.

## 4. Re: Comment#5
We apologize for the inaccuracies in the writing of our paper. We will correct these inaccurate claims in our paper. What we meant to convey is that 1) on the one hand, existing generic preference pair data [2-4] is often fixed and lacks the ability to dynamically adjust for each model's capabilities and knowledge. For the same question, we expect the corresponding preference pair to be different for models capable of answering and those incapable. 2) on the other hand, existing LLMs such as Llama-2 initialize their reward models for RLHF from these generic preference pairs. Although subsequent optimization is based on human feedback and model sampling results, poor initialization can significantly affect the model's sampling space, making it difficult for the final model to have good reliability.

We hope the above responses can address your concerns.

[Reviewer_tasN]: 1. Thank you for the new results on TriviaQA! How did you construct the preference data for the reward model? Moreover, this only compares RLKF to using a system prompt. Do you compare RLKF to regular RLHF?

2. It remains unclear to me why examples of ""rejection > incorrect"" preferences would not naturally be present in existing methods for preference data collection. However if these preferences are sampled from the LM, I buy the authors' argument that models do not naturally know how to decline unless explicitly taught.

3. Thank you for clarifying!

4. The statement that ""*existing LLMs such as Llama-2 initialize their reward models for RLHF from these generic preference pairs*"" is untrue, to the best of my understanding. I believe the reward model is initialized using responses sampled from (variants of) Llama2 (and continuously updated using the latest iteration of the finetuned model). It is not initialized from a static dataset of preference data.

For reference, I share a snippet from the Llama 2 tech report below:
> We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose between **two sampled model responses**, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the two responses to a given prompt are sampled from **two different model variants**, and varying the temperature hyper-parameter.

[...]

> Human annotations were **collected in batches on a weekly basis**. As we collected more preference data, our reward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions for Llama 2-Chat (see the results in Section 5, Figure 20). Llama 2-Chat improvement also shifted the model’s data distribution. Since reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from hyper-specialization (Scialom et al., 2020b), **it is important before a new Llama 2-Chat tuning iteration to gather new preference data using the latest Llama 2-Chat iterations**. This step helps keep the reward model on-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model.

[Authors]: Thanks for your comments! We give our responses below:

# 1. Re: Comment 1

- We construct the preference pairs following the same construction setting of in-domain preference data in our paper.  When the model's multiple sampling results are all correct, we use pairs where the correct answer is preferred over a refusal. When all results are incorrect, we use pairs where a refusal is preferred over the incorrect answer. When the sampling results are mixed, we use pairs where the correct answer is preferred over the incorrect answer. We use the exact match metric instead of accuracy to determine if each sampling result is correct.
- Due to time constraints, we did not run the RLHF baseline. We will include the relevant experiments in future version. Additionally, since the reward model used in RLHF does not incorporate the preference data regarding refusals as in RLKF, we believe it cannot effectively improve the model's truthfulness, as demonstrated by our results on the arithmetic dataset in the paper.

# 2. Re: Comment 4

Thank you for your clarification! We indeed had a misunderstanding regarding the initialization of the reward model in Llama-2. We will correct the inaccurate claims in our paper. The core difference between our method and the RLHF method is that we explicitly introduced the rejection preference pairs in the training of the reward model. This allows the reward model to better understand when to refuse. As shown in Table 4 of our paper, the reward model trained with helpful preference data only achieved an accuracy of 49.9 on the ""beyond"" subset of the in-domain arithmetic reliable preference data (this task is binary classification, where the reward model chooses between refusing to respond and responding incorrectly, with the correct label being refusal). However, after adding the corresponding in-domain reliable preference data (i.e., various preference pairs regarding refusals), this classification accuracy significantly improved to 83.0. This partly explains why RLKF can better improve the model's reliability compared to RLHF, as the reward model after RLKF can better determine when it should refuse."

[Reviewer_BhhP]: Dear author,

Thanks for the detailed rebuttal. 

1) Regarding the generalizability of the framework, like I mentioned before, the approach is flexible in the sense that it provides a rough guideline/steps in generating data for novel tasks. However, to actually apply them, a user has to experiment with prompt engineering at each step that works best for their particular task. In that sense, the generalizability is still limited. 
2) Thanks for providing the table of comparison with existing approaches, however I was referring to a comparison of scores obtained with those methods. I do notice that it is presented in response to Reviewer QmfM. Adding these comparisons will certainly make your claims better.
3) Regarding the last point, on effect of instruction. I would like to explain myself better, as this is also related to point 1) here.

Say for MultiRC, the following instruction is being used in the paper

```
Given a paragraph, frame a question that requires information from multiple sentences of
the paragraph to be answered correctly. Then, generate a set of options. The correct answer may
be a combination of one, some, or all options. Also include options that do not answer the above
question. Finally, output the combination of options that form the correct answer.
```

But I decide to provide a similar instruction like the one below

```
Read the text thoroughly to understand its content and themes. Create a question that requires integrating information from multiple sentences of the text. For each question, provide four to five option sentences that might seem relevant. it is not necessary that a combination of sentences answer the question. The options should test the reader’s ability to synthesize and evaluate information from the text, not just recall facts.
```

Now two points that I had previously raised
1) Would it be fair to say that for each task and step, one has to do fair amount of prompt engineering to be able to elicit outputs for a step in Targen?
2) Given two such varied but similar instructions, how much does it affect my downstream performance?

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for their feedback and clarification of their concerns.

To understand the effect of prompt variations on different downstream tasks, we conducted an experiment where we generated 2 additional variations of the Step 3 prompt for CommitmentBank dataset. Llama-2 7b was fine-tuned on these alternative synthetic datasets alongside our initially generated synthetic dataset and evaluated on the original test set. 
We use the following prompts for this experiment:


Variation 1: [from paper]
```
The input contains a premise and a hypothesis.
1. If the hypothesis logically follows the premise and the hypothesis can be derived from the information in the premise, Output “entailment”
2. If the hypothesis directly contradicts information in the premise, Output “contradiction”
3. If the hypothesis is unrelated to the premise, or cannot be sufficiently proven from the information in the premise, Output “neutral”
```

Variation 2: 
```
The input consists of a premise and a hypothesis.
Output ""neutral"" if the hypothesis is either unrelated to the premise or cannot be conclusively derived from it.
Output ""contradiction"" if the hypothesis directly opposes the information in the premise.
Output ""entailment"" if the hypothesis logically follows from and can be deduced from the premise.
```

Variation 3: 
```
The input consists of a premise and a hypothesis.
If the hypothesis is directly opposed to the information in the premise, output “contradiction.”
If the hypothesis logically follows from the premise and can be inferred from its information, output “entailment.”
If the hypothesis is unrelated to the premise or lacks sufficient evidence from the premise, output “neutral.”
```

The results of the experiments are attached below:

| Dataset                               | Mean CosineSimilarity | Accuracy - LLama-2 7B |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Synthetic with variation 1 [in paper] | 0.56                  | 94.85                 |
| Synthetic with variation 2            | 0.42                  | 93.27                 |
| Synthetic with variation 3            | 0.47                  | 94.14                 |


We see from the above results that there is slight variation in the final results and similar mean cosine similarity. 

We would also like to highlight that the motivation behind proposing a clearly-defined, task-agnostic guiding framework such as TarGEN is to constrain the prompt generation to a series of simpler, clearly defined subtasks. The cascaded stepwise approach has the following advantage: At each step, the subtask for which we prompt the model is straightforward with very little room for misinterpretation and errors. This reduces the prompt engineering effort significantly, especially compared to the human cost of engineering a single prompt that completely and accurately models a complex task. Any prompt that adheres to the instructions for that particular step in the framework is likely to generate similar outcomes, making this framework task- and prompt- agnostic.

Additionally - the constrained, straightforward nature of the task prompt at each step makes it less likely that any variance in prompt would cause a significant change in outcome, given the narrower scope of the objective at each step and the fact that the outcomes are grounded in the response to the previous step. Furthermore, any slight deviances could be attributable to the randomness inherent in inferring with LLMs, but we would not expect to see a significant difference in quality or diversity of the output samples. 

If there are any areas that you still find unclear or require further clarification, we would be more than happy to provide additional information to ensure a comprehensive understanding of our work. Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to hearing from you soon.

[Reviewer_BhhP]: Dear authors,

Thanks for conducting these additional experiments regarding the variability of prompts. I appreciate these efforts and believe adding them will result in a more meaningful analysis.

Given the fact that you have conducted stronger baseline comparison and ablation on prompt variability, I am inclined to increase the score."

[Authors]: Thank you for your thoughtful comment! We are definitely mindful of the significance of the empirical results.

For results about A1 and A2 reported in Figure 4, we are doing a single run on each instance. Considering the large number of test instances (5000 and 7000), making multiple runs is in fact unnecessary and not that practical (note that running all the methods with GPT-4 costs several thousand dollars per run). To make this point more concrete, we are conducting this evaluation according to the standard procedure established in the original papers about these two datasets [1][2], and following the practices from recent well-received papers with state-of-the-art baselines [3]. Specifically in A2, we are directly comparing the results from Adlakha et al. [3], which include results from only one run. We are using the default temperature in the OpenAI API.

For A3, we are following the exact same experimental setting as the ReAct [4] paper and include **3 runs for each method**. The temperature is set to 0.

For A4, considering the number of data instances is not that large, we add more runs, and the aggregated results (including both average and error bars) from 10 total runs are reported below:

| Model        | Multi/Single-Agent | Accuracy (mean ± std) | F1 Score (mean ± std) |

[Authors]: We sincerely thank the reviewer for the additional comments and suggestions. Please see our detailed clarifications about technical novelty below:

- 3M-Diffusion studies a novel problem about text-guided molecular graph generations. **The task of generating diverse, novel molecules that match textual descriptions is challenging due to the sparsity and discrete nature of graph structures.** While there is extensive research on using variational autoencoders (VAEs) or diffusion models (DMs) for molecular graph generation to produce diverse, novel or property-related molecules, there is no existing work that leverages the capabilities of VAEs or DMs to generate molecules that are both diverse, novel, and text-matching. **We believe that the 3M-Diffusion model makes significant technical contributions and novelty by establishing a pipeline capable of generating diverse, novel and text-matching molecular graphs.** This pipeline achieves performance comparable to transformer-based models in terms of ""Similarity,"" which measures the model's text-matching capabilities, and excels at generating diverse and novel molecules.

- Furthermore, we are the first to explore the ability of diffusion models on the latent space of molecular graphs to generate novel, diverse and text-matching molecules. **Specifically, our technical contributions and novel approaches include designing the latent space and creating a suitable scoring networks for latent diffusion tailored to the latent space of molecular graphs, enabling our model to function effectively.**

- Also, in our 3M-Diffusion model, **we do not directly utilize HierVAE's encoder; instead, we employ our own trained encoder that aligns graph and text representations, while only incorporating HierVAE's decoder.** Unlike HierVAE's encoder, which learns hierarchical graph representations but can’t understand text, we propose using an aligned encoder from GIN. This aligned encoder is designed to understand textual descriptions by contrastive learning. **Utilizing this encoder's representation for the decoder and making it effectively generate diverse, novel, and text-matching molecules, represents a significant technical novelty and contribution of our model.**"

**Additional experiment and demonstrations for Q3**

We present molecule-to-text retrieval (M2T) and text-to-molecule retrieval (T2M) tasks by comparing with Sci-BERT [1] and KV-PLM [2] on PubChem. Sci-BERT, pretrained on scientific texts, serves as the initial text encoder for the 3M-Diffusion model. Similarly, KV-PLM, a deep learning system, can be utilized for molecule and text retrieval tasks. Both models employ SMILES to facilitate the molecule and text tasks. Here are the following results:

| Model      | M2T  |       | T2M  |       |
|------------|------|-------|------|-------|
|            | Acc  | R@20  | Acc  | R@20  |
| Sci-BERT   | 39.7 | 85.8  | 37.5 | 85.2  |

| 3M-Diffusion     | **61.7** | **90.8**  | **63.2** | **90.2**  |

We observe that 3M-Diffusion can outperform Sci-BERT and KV-PLM, which verifies the effectiveness of our model for the retrieval task.

[Authors]: >I believe that artificial errors should try to mimic actual errors made by recent LLMs to provide useful observations.

We agree that it is important to know whether the errors in our experiment occur naturally. We have now examined a random sample of errors that GPT-4 makes on the four datasets in our paper. These are questions where GPT-4 did not generate the correct answer in its initial response, before we performed any of the artificial error interventions. These responses were previously discarded in our analyses.

Out of 74 errors, 7 fit the definition of calculation errors provided in the paper. 6 of the other errors involve the model skipping intermediate reasoning steps, similar to the recovery behavior observed in the paper.

The full annotated data is available at [this link](https://github.com/CoTErrorRecovery/CoTErrorRecovery/blob/main/results/error_audit.csv).

Regarding this:

> Faithful recovery and unfaithful recovery are reported as absolute quantities, not as a proportion of all recoveries. 1 - (faithful + unfaithful) is the rate of non-recovery responses.

You label y-axis with ""Faithful Recovery **(%)**"" and ""Unfaithful Recovery **(%)**"" (emphasis mine). Using the percentage symbols for absolute quantities, especially when the total count per error is 100, is misleading. (Also in Table 2). The absolute values also make it hard to compare these faithful recovery rates across error types. This should be improved.

[Authors]: Apologies for our confusing terminology. The y-axis indicates the rate of faithful/unfaithful recovery as a proportion of **all** responses (not just recovery responses). So it is indeed a percentage. This is why 1 - (Faithful Recovery (%) + Unfaithful Recovery (%)) is the rate of non-recovery responses.

[Reviewer_METV]: The proportion of all responses should not be described as ""**absolute** quantities"" as in your previous response. 

I understand what you are calculating now. I still recommend using the total recovery count for normalization to make it easier to compare faithful recovery across different error types with varying recovery counts."

The Toxicity and VaderSentiment scores take the value from 0.0 to 1.0 on a continuous scale with values close to 0.0 representing very little toxicity and lack of negative sentiment respectively. We can see that the scores for our synthetic data are very low, way below 0.50 general threshold for considering a text toxic. This is even for the top 95% percentile of highest-scoring generations. This suggests that our synthetic generations are not toxic. We will be happy to add this analysis to the paper.

*Methodology notes:* VaderSentiment produces individual positive, negative, and neutral sentiment component scores and a compound score. We report just the values for the negative sentiment component as these are the most relevant here. We also analyzed other dimensions provided by ToxicBert such as Identity Attack, Insult, and Threat. The scores were the highest for Toxicity (but still very low in overall terms) so we report these. 

We hope this additional analysis helps to alleviate concerns about toxicity."

[Reviewer_fjaf]: Thank you for your reply, I have no further questions.  I agree with Reviewer n66S that  the generated sentences might still be biased or toxic. I will remain my scores.

[Authors]: We would like to, once again, thank the reviewer for relating to our rebuttal and providing additional comments. Regarding the potential bias, we would like to point to the fact that the same synthetic dataset (synthetic-general) is effective at debiasing across several bias categories in different datasets, which suggests it doesn’t introduce new biases while mitigating others.

However, in light of the concerns around the potential toxicity of our generations, we performed additional analysis using the unbiased [ToxicBert]([https://huggingface.co/unitary/toxic-bert) model (i.e., Detoxicty) as well as a non-neural model for sentiment analysis - [VaderSentiment]([https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment). We present these results in the table below:

| Evaluation Model |    Synthetic Data|     Mean Score (SD) | Top 95% percentile |
| :---- | :----  |-----------------:|----------------------: |
| ToxicBERT *(toxicity)*  | General   | 0.0086 ± 0.0539 | 0.0216 |

1311,Do Membership Inference Attacks Work on Large Language Models?,Accept,jzEliAWirm,,,,"[Authors]: We follow up on questions and comments below and will address the minor comments in our updated revision

[Q1] The validation/test data of the Pile is sampled uniformly at random from the training data ([1], Section 3.1)

[Q2] We appreciate the reviewer bringing these papers to our attention and will include discussion of earlier notions of membership neighborhoods. However, these works seem target a different direction, focusing on generating non-members such that they are falsely identified as members. On the other hand, we explore how neighborhood non-members can still result in information leakage of members, but current MIAs can be too sensitive to classify this member information leakage.

[Q3] We choose to only evaluate blackbox MIAs without stronger data access assumptions for this paper. 

[Q4] We use 1000 bootstrap samples to create the C.I. (See Appendix A.4)

[Q5] We plotted the MIA scores assigned to non-members against their respective {7,13}-gram overlaps; we will add these figures to the Appendix. However, as mentioned in the response to Q3 for reviewer F61L, the important takeaway to clarify in the future revision is that non-member distribution shift (i.e., in n-gram overlap) can inflate MIA, which we felt was better demonstrated by the current design.

[Q6] While we did not include exact statistical significance tests (will be included in revision), The error bars of our results are small enough for our results to imply statistical significance. We will include numbers for these statistical significance tests.

[Q7] We spot checked that documents in the Pile when passed through our pipeline with the ArXiv API from the raw source yielded the same output. We don’t use ArXiv S3 due to paywall.

[Comment 1] Agreed

[C2] We agree it is more similar to reference calibration [2] and will revise accordingly.

[C3] We chose to keep this analysis in the appendix due to space limitations and because we felt a larger ablation over reference model choice was needed to substantiate the plausible analysis.

[Reviewer_sAnK]: Thank you for the response. I have changed my score following the authors' response, as I believe that the reasons to accept the paper outweigh the limitations. However, I still think that the paper should be revised to include the discussion points of the authors' rebuttal and the limitations, as outlined below.

[RR1] Thanks for clarifying this. The authors experiment with multiple reference models and pick the best one for all the remaining analyses, which are performed on the same test set. This can be regarded as a form of tuning and could bias the results. However, looking at subsequent plots, the results and trends identified look stable, which makes me think that the impact of this is quite limited.

[RR2], [RR3] and [RR4] Thanks for the clarifications, please consider adding the information and context provided in your response to the relevant section. Regarding [RR3], I still think that evaluating on 200-word texts limits the scope of the claim (and title) that MIAs in general do not work against LLMs; if the evaluation is limited to short texts then the paper mainly challenges current evaluations on short texts like Shi et al., 2023. Please include a discussion of this limitation and how it possibly impacts the main claim.

[Q1] Can the authors clarify what they mean by validation and test data being sampled from the training data? Does the training data overlap with validation and test data?

[Q2] Thanks for the clarifications.

[Q3] Thanks for clarifying this very important point. Please consider acknowledging this limitation: as only score-based attacks are benchmarked, it remains possible that results of MIAs can be improved if an ML classifier was trained for the task (as opposed to score-based MIAs). The authors construct a test set of in-distribution members and non-members and it isn't clear why a similar training set cannot be constructed. 

[Q4]-[Q7] and [C1]-[C3] Thanks for the clarifications.

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for the helpful discussion. We agree that the discussion points above would be valuable in the future revision and will add them alongside the minor comments from before. Some additional notes:

[RR1] To further clarify, we bolster the observation that MIAs perform near-random when targeting pre-trained LLMs (from the main experiments) by showing the empirically determined best performance of the MIAs. Here, the hyperparameter ablations for reference model or k choice is to form a rough empirical ""upper-bound"" for these attacks' performances. Evaluating MIAs for the sake of determining the best-performing MIA would indeed be biased if such ablations for hyperparameters were done on the same evaluation benchmark, but this is a different goal from what we aim to show in our main experiments.

For the other analysis, we saw that such hyperparameter choices didn't impact the observed trends and chose not to visualize the figures for other hyperparameter choices due to space limitations.

[RR2-4] We will add these clarifications and limitation discussions in the next revision

[Q1] Per the Pile paper, the validation and test sets are sampled randomly from the complete Pile and then held out from the training data. Any overlap between the validation/test sets and the training data is due to the nature of the complete data (as discussed in Section 3.2.2 and in the Pile paper itself), not the sampling/splitting.

[Q3] Using a classifier could yield greater performances. However, this threat model is different as it requires access to a ground truth set of members/non-members, even if only a small set is needed. We will clarify this difference in the future revision."

1306,Revenge of the Fallen? Recurrent Models Match Transformers at Predicting Human Language Comprehension Metrics,Accept,MJt60ulhiS,,,,"[Reviewer_sgiH]: I would like to thank the authors for the response. My response is below:

First, re model selection & optimization, one specific point unclear to me is how the models were trained. I couldn't find training details in the paper, and thus I can't tell if there're tricks to optimize the models.

Second, the authors shape the contents under human cognition theme; and from cognitive plausibility point of view, the authors discuss transformers vs recurrent models. But I really don't think that's relevant because the models have several technical details that aren't proved to be cognitively plausible. How do we know that the used recurrent models outperform the transformer because their recurrent mechanism or because of their cognitively unplausible technical details?

Third, it's unclear what the authors want to conclude here. The authors show performance results, but then what could we learn from them to help us understand human cognition?

[Reviewer_WYrb]: Jumping into this discussion as another reviewer, responding to this point:

> But I really don't think that's relevant because the models have several technical details that aren't proved to be cognitively plausible. 

For what it's worth, as a cognitive scientist, I'd like to point out that there's already a large literature on using models to predict EEG data exactly like in this paper. It's true that some of the mechanisms in the models are cognitively implausible (like multi-head attention in Transformers), but this paper is responding to and joining existing work which has already dealt with a lot of the subtleties in linking LM surprisals to human data.

[Authors]: We would like to thank Reviewer sgiH for their response.

On the first point (optimization/training details), because we used pre-trained models, we did not include the training details and hyperparameters described in the original papers associated with each model type (Pythia: [Biderman et al., 2023](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/biderman23a.html), p. 2 and p. 22; RWKV: [Peng et al., 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.936/), pp. 14065-14066; Mamba: [Gu and Dao, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752), pp. 29-36). In addition, the Pythia GitHub repository (https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia) and the RWKV repository (https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM) each provide the training code, and the Mamba repository (https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba) also provides code that can be used to train the models.

On the second point (cognitive plausibility), we agree with the reviewer that there are certain features of the models’ implementations that may not necessarily be cognitively plausible. However, as Reviewer WYrb notes in their reply to the response, there is still value in (and an active research community engaged in) investigating the differences in how well language models of different architectures can model human language processing. In this case, as we note in the original submission and Reviewer WYrb mentions in their initial review, there are competing accounts of human language processing that can be considered analogous at a computational level to recurrent and transformer architectures—the now-or-never bottleneck in the case of recurrent models (see [Merkx and Frank, 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.cmcl-1.2/)), and cue-based retrieval in the case of transformers (see [Ryu and Lewis, 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.cmcl-1.6/);  [Merkx and Frank, 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.cmcl-1.2/)).

On the third point (conclusions), one of the key questions for our study was how well models of different architectures perform, for the reasons noted in the previous paragraph. Work by [Merkx and Frank (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.cmcl-1.2/) suggests that transformers are indeed empirically better at predicting the amplitude of the N400 at least, and [Ryu and Lewis (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.cmcl-1.6/) provide empirical and theoretical support for the idea that transformers are good models of human language processing. However, our results show that if there is a difference, it is small (and in fact, in the case of the N400, recurrent models tend to be better), which suggests that the transformer architecture may not be as important as previously thought for modeling human language processing. Instead, our results suggest that the question of which type of architecture provides a better computational-level model of human language processing is far from resolved, and that, since the new generation of recurrent models is only in its infancy, this question may need to be revisited as new developments in the field arise."

[Reviewer_sgiH]: I would like to thank the authors for the response. My response is below:

First, re model selection & optimization, one specific point unclear to me is how the models were trained. I couldn't find training details in the paper, and thus I can't tell if there're tricks to optimize the models.

Second, the authors shape the contents under human cognition theme; and from cognitive plausibility point of view, the authors discuss transformers vs recurrent models. But I really don't think that's relevant because the models have several technical details that aren't proved to be cognitively plausible. How do we know that the used recurrent models outperform the transformer because their recurrent mechanism or because of their cognitively unplausible technical details?

Third, it's unclear what the authors want to conclude here. The authors show performance results, but then what could we learn from them to help us understand human cognition?

[Reviewer_WYrb]: Jumping into this discussion as another reviewer, responding to this point:

> But I really don't think that's relevant because the models have several technical details that aren't proved to be cognitively plausible. 

For what it's worth, as a cognitive scientist, I'd like to point out that there's already a large literature on using models to predict EEG data exactly like in this paper. It's true that some of the mechanisms in the models are cognitively implausible (like multi-head attention in Transformers), but this paper is responding to and joining existing work which has already dealt with a lot of the subtleties in linking LM surprisals to human data.

[Authors]: We would like to thank Reviewer sgiH for their response.

On the first point (optimization/training details), because we used pre-trained models, we did not include the training details and hyperparameters described in the original papers associated with each model type (Pythia: [Biderman et al., 2023](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/biderman23a.html), p. 2 and p. 22; RWKV: [Peng et al., 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.936/), pp. 14065-14066; Mamba: [Gu and Dao, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752), pp. 29-36). In addition, the Pythia GitHub repository (https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia) and the RWKV repository (https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM) each provide the training code, and the Mamba repository (https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba) also provides code that can be used to train the models.

On the second point (cognitive plausibility), we agree with the reviewer that there are certain features of the models’ implementations that may not necessarily be cognitively plausible. However, as Reviewer WYrb notes in their reply to the response, there is still value in (and an active research community engaged in) investigating the differences in how well language models of different architectures can model human language processing. In this case, as we note in the original submission and Reviewer WYrb mentions in their initial review, there are competing accounts of human language processing that can be considered analogous at a computational level to recurrent and transformer architectures—the now-or-never bottleneck in the case of recurrent models (see [Merkx and Frank, 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.cmcl-1.2/)), and cue-based retrieval in the case of transformers (see [Ryu and Lewis, 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.cmcl-1.6/);  [Merkx and Frank, 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.cmcl-1.2/)). We thank the reviewer for pointing out that this may not necessarily be clear in the submitted version; we will clarify and expand upon this point in the revised version.

On the other hand, I still find that the amount of detail that the authors share in the paper and the rebuttal (excluding what they promise since some of it can be trivially answered in the rebuttal) is not sufficient for good replication of the training procedure. Especially since RLHF is known to be unstable, this makes replication challenging.

It is also worrying that RM training on the Mistral 7B RM does not work well - authors did not bring this up initially and even after the rebuttal, offered very little data regarding how the Mistral 7B RM does (e.g. Rewardbench) , even though theoretically, a strong preference modeling dataset with millions of preference pairs should be able to train Mistral 7B as well as Llama2 7B. This potentially means that the preference dataset they introduce might only work on specific models, which is extremely surprising and should be discussed with some detail in the paper. 

As impressive as the results are (that I mentioned in the Reasons to Accept), I find the lack of training details concerning. Therefore I will keep my scores the same.

Thus, I maintain my prior assessment of the paper. 

I do want to comment on one aspect of the response regarding the utility. The authors note that they hope their method will ""aid in generating hypotheses through code-like cognitive models [by] they offer[ing] a human-understandable medium that aids model-building [...] to gain insights into human problem-solving strategies."" However, in cognitive science participant introspection has often served this purpose without the need for language models to translate it into code; if a scientist will need to interpret the results after anyway, translating into code will not necessarily help them, especially (again) if that translation is biased and lossy. Thus, again, I think that the utility would ideally be motivated, by demonstrating it enables some clearly novel insight into the data.

[Authors]: Thank you very much for your insightful feedback.

We appreciate the reviewer's recognition of the potential value of introspections in providing richer data compared to pure behavioral data. Indeed, our approach aims to leverage the hypothesis-free nature of introspections to gain deeper insights into human cognition. We acknowledge that there are various methodologies beyond generating codes from introspections using LLMs that can illuminate the cognitive processes underlying these introspections. In parallel with the current study, we are also exploring other avenues to analyze introspections with LLMs at different levels.

We believe that generating codes through LLMs offers a promising avenue of investigation, as it allows for the direct construction of individual cognitive models without relying solely on researchers' interpretations. These models are designed to not only mimic participants' behavior in a task but also to represent their general thinking patterns throughout the task. As a result, they have the potential to generalize and predict out-of-distribution behavioral data. In our study, the codes generated by the LLMs are explicitly instructed to adapt to sorting tasks of varying lengths, capturing the underlying algorithmic patterns rather than merely replicating behaviors.

We acknowledge that the current performance of our approach is not yet optimal and that several biases, including those inherent to LLMs, may be present. Nevertheless, we are confident that by optimizing the codes through program inductions from behaviors or refining our prompts and LLMs, we can achieve more robust performance. This would enable us not only to compare the generated codes to standard algorithms for attribution but also to conduct specific analyses, such as code clustering, to uncover additional insights.

Thank you once again for your valuable feedback. We look forward to further improving our approach and exploring the rich potential of introspections in cognitive research."

The points about LTL(C,+) are well taken. I encourage the authors to make the differences more explicit in the revision.

> Indeed, attention weights may become zero on large enough inputs if we round to the nearest number, but we don't think this is a fatal objection. Another reasonable policy, like rounding up, would avoid this.

If one rounded up values on the order of 1/N to some small nonzero fixed-precision number \epsilon, and then summed up over all inputs, one would get a number on the order \epsilon N simply when each position has the value 1 -- certainly an undesirable situation, and seemingly breaking the proof of Lemma C.7. Perhaps rounding after division leads to more reasonable results. I take the authors' word that they will make this more explicit in the final version.

1268,Counting Like Transformers: Compiling Temporal Counting Logic Into Softmax Transformers,Accept,iqAIvg0gv6,,,,"[Reviewer_TQ9j]: > First, the paper gives the particular example of Dyck-1, which is definable in Kₜ[#] but not FOC[+;MOD]. Many other separating languages exist, due to the inability of FOC[+;MOD] to model ordering, but this is an especially important one. It has clear practical relevance to modeling natural languages and programming languages, and we also know empirically (Ebrahimi, 2020) that transformers can learn Dyck-1.

The inclusion of Dyck1 is nice. Do you have other examples that are not in FOC[+; MOD] but in $K_t[#]$? I ask this because [1] already shows Dyck can be represented by two-layer Transformer. (actually not only dyck1 but also general deck language, but of course it only shows dyck so it has no confliction with this work)

[1]  Self-attention networks can process bounded hierarchical languages, ACL 2021, Yao S, Peng B, Papadimitriou C, et al.

> Second, whereas the translation from FOC[+;MOD] outputs a transformer of bounded depth, our translation from Kₜ[#] outputs deeper transformers for deeper formulas. While we don't know whether deeper transformers are in fact more expressive, we suspect that they are, and practical applications certainly suggest that they are. So the fact that Kₜ[#] translates to deeper transformers suggests Kₜ[#] is much stronger and closer to actual transformers than FOC[+;MOD].

What do you mean by deeper? Does the number of layer you constructed depends on $t$?

[Authors]: We appreciate you taking a second look. See our responses below:

1. Other examples of languages definable in Kₜ[#] but not FOC[+;MOD] include:

- $a^nb^nc^n$ (§3.2), a context-sensitive language  which is also observed to be learnable by [Bhattamishra, 2020].

- All piecewise testable languages, like $\Sigma^\*a\Sigma^\*b\Sigma^\*c\Sigma^\*$ (§3.3).

- All strings with the letter $a$ in the second position and nowhere else. 

- All valid email addresses (name@domain.com)

We make no claim of novelty in showing that Kₜ[#] and therefore transformers can recognize Dyck-1. The paper already cites [Bhattamishra et al, 2020] for showing that transformers recognize a language similar to Dyck-1, and we thank you for pointing out [Yao et al, 2021], which is a better reference.

Our focus here is not just on individual languages, but on the formalisms Kₜ[#] and C-RASP, which provide building blocks that can be combined to show that transformers recognize a whole class of languages.  The fact that [Yao et al, 2021] shows that transformers can recognize Dyck-1 strengthens, rather than weakens, our claim that Kₜ[#] is a better characterization of transformers than FOC[+;MOD].

At present, we don't know how to define Dyck-2 in Kₜ[#], so this would be a good target for future work. But we note that [Yao et al, 2021]'s Theorem B.3 appears to use hard attention, and also relies on Lemma B.1, which implicitly uses a nonstandard variant of layer normalization that can apply only to a subset of vector components (cf. multi-pre-norm from [Merrill and Sabharwal, 2024]). As such, it may not be straightforward to apply their construction directly to standard transformers, which is the setting we are working in. 

2. By ""deeper,"" we mean the number of transformer blocks (where a block is self-attention layer followed by a feed-forward layer).

This is in contrast to FOC[+;MOD], which [Chiang et al, 2023] show can be simulated by a transformer that only needs $2$ blocks. Since in practice it seems that deeper transformers are better for more complex applications, it seems to be a strength of Kₜ[#] that it translates into deeper transformers.

[Reviewer_TQ9j]: > First, the paper gives the particular example of Dyck-1, which is definable in Kₜ[#] but not FOC[+;MOD]. Many other separating languages exist, due to the inability of FOC[+;MOD] to model ordering, but this is an especially important one. It has clear practical relevance to modeling natural languages and programming languages, and we also know empirically (Ebrahimi, 2020) that transformers can learn Dyck-1.

The inclusion of Dyck1 is nice. Do you have other examples that are not in FOC[+; MOD] but in $K_t[#]$? I ask this because [1] already shows Dyck can be represented by two-layer Transformer. (actually not only dyck1 but also general deck language, but of course it only shows dyck so it has no confliction with this work)

[1]  Self-attention networks can process bounded hierarchical languages, ACL 2021, Yao S, Peng B, Papadimitriou C, et al.

> Second, whereas the translation from FOC[+;MOD] outputs a transformer of bounded depth, our translation from Kₜ[#] outputs deeper transformers for deeper formulas. While we don't know whether deeper transformers are in fact more expressive, we suspect that they are, and practical applications certainly suggest that they are. So the fact that Kₜ[#] translates to deeper transformers suggests Kₜ[#] is much stronger and closer to actual transformers than FOC[+;MOD].

What do you mean by deeper? Does the number of layer you constructed depends on $t$?

[Authors]: We appreciate you taking a second look. See our responses below:

1. Other examples of languages definable in Kₜ[#] but not FOC[+;MOD] include:

- $a^nb^nc^n$ (§3.2), a context-sensitive language  which is also observed to be learnable by [Bhattamishra, 2020].

- All piecewise testable languages, like $\Sigma^\*a\Sigma^\*b\Sigma^\*c\Sigma^\*$ (§3.3).

- All strings with the letter $a$ in the second position and nowhere else. 

- All valid email addresses (name@domain.com)

We make no claim of novelty in showing that Kₜ[#] and therefore transformers can recognize Dyck-1. The paper already cites [Bhattamishra et al, 2020] for showing that transformers recognize a language similar to Dyck-1, and we thank you for pointing out [Yao et al, 2021], which is a better reference.

Our focus here is not just on individual languages, but on the formalisms Kₜ[#] and C-RASP, which provide building blocks that can be combined to show that transformers recognize a whole class of languages.  The fact that [Yao et al, 2021] shows that transformers can recognize Dyck-1 strengthens, rather than weakens, our claim that Kₜ[#] is a better characterization of transformers than FOC[+;MOD].

At present, we don't know how to define Dyck-2 in Kₜ[#], so this would be a good target for future work. But we note that [Yao et al, 2021]'s Theorem B.3 appears to use hard attention, and also relies on Lemma B.1, which implicitly uses a nonstandard variant of layer normalization that can apply only to a subset of vector components (cf. multi-pre-norm from [Merrill and Sabharwal, 2024]). As such, it may not be straightforward to apply their construction directly to standard transformers, which is the setting we are working in. 

2. By ""deeper,"" we mean the number of transformer blocks (where a block is self-attention layer followed by a feed-forward layer). Our construction simulates a Kₜ[#] formula that has modal depth $k$ (§3.3) by a transformer with $4k+1$ blocks. (We are unsure what you mean by $t$, but to be clear, the depth of the transformer does not depend on the input string length.)

This is in contrast to FOC[+;MOD], which [Chiang et al, 2023] show can be simulated by a transformer that only needs $2$ blocks. Since in practice it seems that deeper transformers are better for more complex applications, it seems to be a strength of Kₜ[#] that it translates into deeper transformers.

[Reviewer_NmSc]: I thank the authors for the useful response.

The points about LTL(C,+) are well taken. I encourage the authors to make the differences more explicit in the revision.

> Indeed, attention weights may become zero on large enough inputs if we round to the nearest number, but we don't think this is a fatal objection. Another reasonable policy, like rounding up, would avoid this.

If one rounded up values on the order of 1/N to some small nonzero fixed-precision number \epsilon, and then summed up over all inputs, one would get a number on the order \epsilon N simply when each position has the value 1 -- certainly an undesirable situation, and seemingly breaking the proof of Lemma C.7. Perhaps rounding after division leads to more reasonable results. I take the authors' word that they will make this more explicit in the final version.

In reaction to the authors' response, I am increasing my score.

- Question 7: I understand that the ""causal understanding errors"" and ""visual grounding errors"" conceptually do not have to be mutually exclusive, but having overlap would lead to complications in following analysis, and in fact without revealing the overlap count, the reported information is incomplete. I would argue that, it might be worthwhile to break down the ""causal understanding errors"" into two parts, one due to grounding errors, the other due to the VLM making wrong connections.

[Authors]: We thank reviewer habn for valuable comments. Please note that we didn’t answer some questions because of the 2500 character limit. We are happy to discuss them more here.

>### Revising the sentence on page 5, in section 4.2

We thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback. We will revise the sentence to: `""precision"" should permit the critics to expand the set of human-annotated negative events`. 

We also plan to revise the first sentence in the same paragraph to: `Recall and precision are fundamental metrics in assessing behavior critics **on videos that showcase suboptimal behaviors**.`

>### Revealing the overlap count of ""causal understanding errors"" and ""visual grounding errors""

The number of overlapping cases is 12 for GPT-4V without grounding feedback. These cases account for nearly 50% of the ""causal understanding errors"" (25 cases) but make up only a small fraction of the ""visual grounding errors"" (116 cases).

We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion to break down the “causal understanding error”, and we will revise the paper accordingly.

>### Q4. The taxonomy focuses on false alarms.

In general, “missing undesirable behaviors” means the VLM didn’t generate criticisms for some undesirable events in negative videos. This leaves very limited space for us to analyze the “failure modes” (in contrast, in the case of false alarms, the VLM at least outputs something, which gives us more space to investigate the discrepancy between the inaccurate output and the “ground truth”). 

If the reviewer is interested in or inquiring about the patterns of the occurrence of “missing undesirable behaviors” errors, we did conduct some preliminary examination and didn’t observe any clear pattern. Such errors occur “evenly” across the test samples (with different task types and environments). The occurrence is generally unpredictable – the VLM may succeed in one test case while miss a similar negative event in another test case with minor variations (e.g., same type of manipulation task but with a different object, such as orange -> eggplant, or on a different table). We can include a discussion on this in the final version.

Another reason why we focused more on false alarms is because false alarms could mislead/disrupt policy generation more compared to “missing undesirable behaviors” (although the latter means humans need to spend more time in supervising policy generation/learning).

>### Q6. Could the ""critique operationalizability"" be improved by prompt engineering or few-shot in-context examples?

We experimented with asking follow-up questions (with in-context examples) to GPT-4V to get more concrete & actionable critiques. We found that, although GPT became more verbose, its responses were not significantly more actionable compared to the original critiques. After all, giving operationalizable critiques sometimes can be as hard as solving the plan generation problem. 

Please note that we have chosen to leave this for future research and therefore haven’t included these findings in the current version. We believe more comprehensive experiments are needed before drawing conclusions. We would also like to note that this may be out of the scope of this study as we have put substantial resources into dataset construction, manual/human evaluation of VLM critiques and real-robot experiments.

[Reviewer_habn]: Thank you very much for the further response sharing insightful findings. My positive opinion of this work remains unchanged, and I'll maintain my rating as 8."

[Authors]: Dear AC,

We had our responses/rebuttal right under Reviewer 2XFC's comments. Could you please let us know if we have missed anything specific? 

We believe the only unanswered question was regarding the prompt template for Gemini Pro. We didn’t answer this in our initial rebuttal due to the 2500-character limit, but we are happy to provide a clarification here. Please note that, **at the time of this COLM submission, gemini-pro-vision (Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision) was the only widely released multi-modal model in the Gemini family**. Its capability is not comparable to GPT-4V and other newer & larger Gemini models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.0 Ultra (which is still not available through Gemini API). Hence, due to the model’s limited vision and reasoning capability, we find that Gemini-1.0-Pro-Vision did not offer improved performance even after careful tuning of the prompt template and in-context examples. We could provide some preliminary results from newer Gemini models at the time of camera ready if time permits. Besides, since Gemini-1.0-Pro-Vision is optimized for completion rather than chat/conservation, we also tried and made several prompt adaptations, such as in the ways of integrating grounding feedback (instead of providing feedback in follow-up messages as done for GPT-4V, we append the feedback as “auxiliary information” or as extra notes to the initial prompt). However, our results indicate these adaptations do not affect the output quality noticeably. All these findings suggest that the readers / future research should consider using the largest and latest Gemini models whenever possible. We can put a note regarding this in the revision.

In addition to this, please feel free to let us know if there are any other explanations we can provide.

Thank you."

1217,Pack of LLMs: Model Fusion at Test-Time via Perplexity Optimization,Accept,WdHOPYPOyp,,,,"[Reviewer_MKGz]: Thanks for the authors' responses. However, it is still unconvincing to me. For example, what's the point of including cBTM and DExperts in Table 1 without reproducing the full experiments on all compared domain datasets? If all the experts and LLMs are known to cBTM and DExperts methods, do the proposed methods still outperform them? For Table 2, the last ""Best Overall"" column is misleading; the results are not comparable among the methods. I am still concerned about this.

[Authors]: **Comparison with cBTM & DExperts**. Thank you for your follow-up questions. cBTM’s LLMs are fine-tuned on top of the OPT model family, which are not relatively powerful models. For example, if we use cBTM’s LLMs, they perform ~25% at accuracy on MMLU, which is close to random answer selection. Generalizing cBTM to other model families for producing full results in Table 1 requires (i) proper data selection, and (ii) further model fine-tuning, which is limiting regarding compute resources. If all experts are known, PackLLM outperforms cBTM (Misc in Table 1)  and DExperts (Medicine in Table 1).

Following, we highlight the key difference between cBTM, DExperts, and PackLLM (ours) regarding how they compute the importance weights:
- *cBTM*: Importance weights are **data-dependent** (Eq. 8; using tf-idf embeddings); the weights would be similar for LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-70B as the two models have similar pretraining data.
- *DExperts*: Importance weights are **fixed** (Eq. 9).
- *PackLLM*: Importance weights are **model-dependent** (perplexity-based), capturing how well each model understands the prompt; LLaMA-70B would be assigned a higher weight than LLaMA-7B.

Figure 3 verifies the benefit of model-dependent weights (PackLLM vs. cBTM / DExperts).

**Q1) Impact of aligning different tokenizers**. Thank you for your insightful question. We do not have any experimental analysis evaluating the impact of the vocabulary size, but we agree that it would be easier to fuse knowledge from models with similar-sized vocabularies (e.g., LLama + Mistral) than models with different vocabularies (e.g., LLama + Gemma). Disentangling the effects of combining models with different vocabularies, e.g. LLama + Mistral vs. LLama + Gemma, is challenging as different models (Mistral vs. Gemma) perform differently on the underlying tasks.

**Q2) Evaluating best LLM**.
Thank you for your suggestion. We experiment with the best LLM (as evaluated on test data) on STEM and Commonsense tasks. We find that the best LLM works better when having few LLMs with different vocabularies, but when we have a large number of LLMs with the same vocabulary, PackLLM outperforms the best LLM. We hope with better tokenization mapping methods, PackLLM becomes more effective in the first scenario.

To further verify our conclusions, we experiment on the C4 and S2ORC language modeling tasks, where we have a large number of expert OPT models sharing the same vocabulary. In this case, PackLLM also outperforms the Best LLM (selected as the top1 expert). 

We provide the results in the following tables.

Setup: 5 MMLU-STEM tasks and 4 Commonsense tasks.
Best LLM: LLaMA2-7B (Fuse LLMs), Platypus-7B (FoE LLMs)

| |Fuse LLMs (3 seed LLMs, different vocab) | FoE LLMs (15 seed LLMs, same vocab) |

Best LLM (using test data) | **33.0** / **56.3** | 34.8 / 59.1 |

Setup: 9 OPT models (30B OPT + 8* 1.3 OPT experts) on C4 and S2ORC language modeling tasks.

| Select Best (Top1 model) | 12.53 / 11.46 |
|PackLLM | **11.03** / **11.05** |

**Q3) Timing of PackLLM**. Thank you for your clarifying question. PackLLM can be applied in real-world scenarios as it does not incur significant additional costs. PackLLM computes the output logits by each LLM once (as in the Ensemble baseline), which are then used for determining the importance weights as shown in Lines 10-15 of Algorithm 1 in Appendix A. No additional LLM forward passes are required. 

We also provide the following time measurements for K=5 LLMs per input on a A100 GPU:

| | Time|
|-|-|
|Single forward pass | 0.06 secs |
| K=5 forward passes (Ensemble) | 0.30 secs |
| PackLLM (K=5) | 0.32 secs |
As evaluated, PackLLM does not incur significant time costs.

|PackLLM | **11.03** / **11.05** |

**Q3) Timing of PackLLM**. Thank you for your clarifying question. PackLLM can be applied in real-world scenarios as it does not incur significant additional costs. PackLLM computes the output logits by each LLM once (as in the Ensemble baseline), which are then used for determining the importance weights as shown in Lines 10-15 of Algorithm 1 in Appendix A. No additional LLM forward passes are required. 

We also provide the following time measurements for K=5 LLMs per input on a A100 GPU:

| | Time|
|-|-|
|Single forward pass | 0.06 secs |
| K=5 forward passes (Ensemble) | 0.30 secs |
| PackLLM (K=5) | 0.32 secs |
As evaluated, PackLLM does not incur significant time costs.

[Reviewer_MKGz]: Thanks for the authors' responses. However, it is still unconvincing to me. For example, what's the point of including cBTM and DExperts in Table 1 without reproducing the full experiments on all compared domain datasets? If all the experts and LLMs are known to cBTM and DExperts methods, do the proposed methods still outperform them? For Table 2, the last ""Best Overall"" column is misleading; the results are not comparable among the methods. I am still concerned about this.

[Authors]: **Comparison with cBTM & DExperts**. Thank you for your follow-up questions. cBTM’s LLMs are fine-tuned on top of the OPT model family, which are not relatively powerful models. For example, if we use cBTM’s LLMs, they perform ~25% at accuracy on MMLU, which is close to random answer selection. Generalizing cBTM to other model families for producing full results in Table 1 requires (i) proper data selection, and (ii) further model fine-tuning, which is limiting regarding compute resources. If all experts are known, PackLLM outperforms cBTM (Misc in Table 1)  and DExperts (Medicine in Table 1).

Following, we highlight the key difference between cBTM, DExperts, and PackLLM (ours) regarding how they compute the importance weights:
- *cBTM*: Importance weights are **data-dependent** (Eq. 8; using tf-idf embeddings); the weights would be similar for LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-70B as the two models have similar pretraining data.
- *DExperts*: Importance weights are **fixed** (Eq. 9).
- *PackLLM*: Importance weights are **model-dependent** (perplexity-based), capturing how well each model understands the prompt; LLaMA-70B would be assigned a higher weight than LLaMA-7B.

Figure 3 verifies the benefit of model-dependent weights (PackLLM vs. cBTM / DExperts).

**Table 2**. Thank you for pointing this out. We will remove the “Overall” column to improve the readability of Table 2."

I have some follow-up questions. 

In the improver improving process, during meta-utility calculation, do you only apply the current improver only once on the initial solution? I'm curious to know if the meta-utility function could be improved if the improver was applied either a fixed number of times on an initial solution or if it was applied on a couple of initial solutions per task? 
How noisy is the meta-utility function given that it is the only (and most important) signal to improve the improver with?

Is there a guarantee that using $improver_t$ is better than ${improver}_{t-1}$ at improving an ""improver"" ? From the meta-utility function we know that it would be better at improving initial solutions for a set of tasks, but is improving an improver the same as improving an initial solution of a task (which I believe is of a different nature)?

[Authors]: Great questions!

We define the meta-utility (as in Algo 1) as the average downstream task utility obtained when the improver is applied once to D independently sampled downstream task problem instances. For our main experiments we sampled 5 identical instances of the improvement task (see Sec 5.1). In practice, the meta-utility is stochastic and a few proposed model solutions depend on this (like a bandit that aimed to select the best improvement). And as you point out, there's no guarantee that a self-improved improver is actually better than the previous in terms of meta-utility, and for the weaker models we see this in practice. This also makes the task of finding an improver that works on a purely language-based downstream task (rather than just code) more tricky.

Thank you again!"

[Authors]: Thank you so much for taking the time to read our response. We are glad that our answers have addressed some of your concerns. Regarding your point about the assessment of our framework emphasizing cultural unity, we would like to share some thoughts below.

Given our focus on cross-cultural alignment, we can evaluate our cross-cultural similarity framework's practical benefits through downstream applications like matching translation. Following prior work on culturally-aware machine translation [1] and human translation theories [2], we learn that many culture-specific concepts in a source language lack direct equivalents in a target language. In these cases, professional human translators often use two translation strategies: (1) providing an additional explanation of the term in the target language and (2) substituting the concept with a culturally equivalent one that target language speakers can easily understand. Compared to traditional NMTS, mainly trained on parallel corpora, LLMs have a unique advantage in performing these explanation-based strategies. Therefore, our cross-cultural similarity framework could provide an initial step in assessing whether LLMs can identify culturally equivalent concepts.

With the clarified practical insights, I am raising my score slightly.

[Authors]: Thank you for acknowledging our response.

We are glad that the misunderstanding about our main contribution—explicitly accounting for the fact that multiple tokens (labels) can follow a given sequence of tokens (context) in the training corpus, resulting in a **sparse** soft-label setup—has been addressed. 

We reiterate that combining this viewpoint with unconstrained features offers a new perspective in studying word/context embeddings. Given the originality and timeliness (word embedding geometry studies date back to the word2vec era and have recently surged in the context of LLMs), we believe our contribution is valuable to the community.

Additionally, beyond the motivational figures on embedding geometry, some of our theoretical analysis already applies to the regime d<V. For instance, in Appendix C.3.1 (see definition 4 and in the paragraph below), we show that the feasibility of NTP-SVM with an additional constraint rank(L)≤d is necessary and sufficient for the model to reach the entropy lower bound. We consider this a fundamental result. Besides, the results remain non-trivial even when d>V. Therefore, we respectfully disagree with the assessment that our work lacks in becoming a “more worthwhile” contribution."

[Reviewer_wYxA]: Re 1: Oh, you're right, I must have misunderstood that!

Re d>V: Additional results on this seen to a proper conclusion like in the submitted paper may raise this to be a more worthwhile contribution, but I don't think that would be ready in time for a camera-ready...

With the clarified practical insights, I am raising my score slightly.

[Authors]: Thank you for acknowledging our response.

We are glad that the misunderstanding about our main contribution—explicitly accounting for the fact that multiple tokens (labels) can follow a given sequence of tokens (context) in the training corpus, resulting in a **sparse** soft-label setup—has been addressed. 

We reiterate that combining this viewpoint with unconstrained features offers a new perspective in studying word/context embeddings. Given the originality and timeliness (word embedding geometry studies date back to the word2vec era and have recently surged in the context of LLMs), we believe our contribution is valuable to the community.

Additionally, beyond the motivational figures on embedding geometry, some of our theoretical analysis already applies to the regime d<V. For instance, in Appendix C.3.1 (see definition 4 and in the paragraph below), we show that the feasibility of NTP-SVM with an additional constraint rank(L)≤d is necessary and sufficient for the model to reach the entropy lower bound. We consider this a fundamental result. Besides, the results remain non-trivial even when d>V. Therefore, we respectfully disagree with the assessment that our work lacks in becoming a “more worthwhile” contribution."

[Reviewer_AKL7]: Thank you for the responses!  The additional explanation and results do help.  If the paper is accepted, I hope that you can add the additional results.  That being said, the experimental settings are still toy-ish, and that more realistic experiments could have been done (if that is not the case, I would be happy to be corrected!).  For this reason I continue to feel that the paper is only marginally above the acceptance threshold.

I welcome the presentation changes and believe including additional discussions will benefit the paper. I have raised my score accordingly. However, while I acknowledge the existence of sexually explicit requests, and as mentioned in my initial review, I would still be very interested to see an analysis of non-fictional data that is actually of the author (as otherwise, I am not sure of the relevance of the presented PII counts).

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for engaging in discussion with us and raising their score! 

As requested, we are providing a further breakdown into the results and PII provided by users in Wildchat. We used GPT-4 to annotate 5000 conversations, asking it to annotate the requested task, if there is personal information provided, and to provide the type of the personal information (as also described in the paper). We find that 21% of the queries include what is identified as sensitive information by GPT-4, however, filtering by task to throw out fictional cases (there is instances of role-playing, creative writing, etc.) omits 31.3% of these cases, leaving an overall of 14.5% of queries that include what can be considered as ‘real PII’, but we do acknowledge that these could still include some PII that is not sensitive/of real users. To further analyze these, we sorted the queries including personal information by their tasks, and found that text editing or writing tasks (CV editing, letter/email/statement generation) do overall contain the bulk of PII (34.0% of the non-fictional sensitive queries), which include the authors name as expected, for instance:

```
...my cv:\\n\\nIbrahim A Ibrahim Gaddari\\tFLT 10, Tropea Court, Triq in-nazzarenu \\n\\t(+356) 9974 5663\\n\\t\\n\\n\\nASPIRATIONS\\nSeeking the right corporate environment within which I may gain practical experience...
```

One surprising category with PIIs is the task ‘translation’ (6.6%), as people tend to mindlessly copy and paste their personal information as part of a sequence to be translated, here is an example:

```
….Letter of Guarantee from Daughter This letter is to confirm that I, Zeqi Qian, am the daughter of Qunlei Qian and that I have invited my father to visit the UK as a tourist. I will begin my course in Engineering Science as a first-year student at Oxford University in October. My passport number is EJ6489540, and my student visa number is 022531800….
```

Apart from translation, another surprising common category of queries that involves self-disclosure of PIIs is code editing (20.4%), as people tend to dump their code with their name, email address and API tokens in comments to chatGPT:

```
import Optional from aiogram import types API_TOKEN = '6084658919:AAGcYQUODSWD8g0LJ8Ina6FcRZTLxg92s2w'
```

We believe that such high, inadvertent disclosure rates are of significant importance for researchers and data curators to be aware of, and call for design of appropriate nudging mechanisms in services such as ChatGPT. We will add these case studies and the fine-grained analysis to the paper. Please let us know if there is any further information we can provide!

1157,RAVEN: In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models,Accept,2AGMEDXGTT,,,,"[Reviewer_gDcV]: Thanks for the authors' response! I'm sorry for being confused. Let me try to clarify my questions. From my perspective, ICL is not a very common practice for RAG due to the following concerns: 
- **Effectiveness:** I haven't seen many cases where ICL contributes substantially to RAG, though it's useful in many other situations. If there are examples where it does, please remind me. 
- **Running cost:** Applying RAG is already costly due to the encoding of retrieved information. Introducing ICL will add considerable extra costs.

As a result, I still cannot agree with the motivation of the paper, though it made meaningful progress in improving upon Altas.

[Authors]: Thank you for your feedback! We would like to further clarify and strengthen our response to your concerns.

> Effectiveness of ICL in RAG:

The motivation for using ICL with retrieval is aligned with its application in models without retrieval. In most cases, retrieval just adds external knowledge to the model's context but does not fundamentally change the task being performed. If ICL can work on tasks for a model without retrieval, there is no reason why it should not be applied to a model with retrieval. Both ICL and RAG are important and common usages of LLMs; they are orthogonal and don't conflict with each other. Therefore, there must be many use cases of ICL with retrieval, such as answering a factual-seeking question with the help of examples, solving knowledge-intensive tasks with the help of examples, writing a passage (which may require retrieval to collect the knowledge) based on some examples, etc. And empirical evidence in our paper exactly demonstrates that ICL enhances performance in models with retrieval on popular tasks such as Open-domain QA and MMLU.

> Running Cost of ICL:

While it's true that ICL introduces additional costs, we designed our approach to minimize these costs effectively. Here are the key points regarding cost management:

- **Efficiency in Prompt Design:** In our implementation, we do not retrieve passages for in-context examples (i.e., only retrieve passages for the target query). Therefore, the additional tokens introduced by ICL in our setting are the same as traditional ICL.

- **Linear Cost Growth with FiCL:** The computation cost of FiCL grows linearly with the number of in-context examples, as it performs self-attention over one (or $m$) example(s) at a time. This is more efficient than decoder-only LMs, where the time complexity is quadratic. This efficiency allows us to leverage the benefits of ICL without incurring prohibitive costs.

In summary, our paper provides strong empirical evidence and methodological innovations that support the use of ICL in RAG settings, demonstrating meaningful performance improvements without incurring unsustainable costs. We believe that these contributions are significant and address both the effectiveness and cost concerns you raised. 

We hope our response addresses your concerns. Please let us know your thoughts, and we are more than happy to answer any further questions.

[Reviewer_gDcV]: Thanks for the authors' response! I'm increasing my overall assessment to 6 after having calibration with other papers in my batch. I think the paper basically presents a quality study in this field.  

However, I'm still uncertain about the necessity of using ICL for RAG. The improvement can be very marginal with the latest LLMs whereas the additional cost from using ICL will be substantial. The authors may provide a comprehensive investigation in their future research.

[Authors]: Thank you for your feedback!

1157,RAVEN: In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models,Accept,HX9LdS6r67,,,,"[Reviewer_A7yJ]: Hi! Thanks for the response. I still have a couple questions that I'm confused about around how ATLAS was used in this work, and would like to see if my understanding is right.

ATLAS is a modification of the Contriever/T5 architecture that was pretrained on various ""pretext"" tasks on general datasets. They released several models and this work uses the 3B and 11B models base models (not the ones fine-tuned on NQ). RAVEN then does additional (pre)training of the encoder/decoder with the modified objective, and no finetuning at all on the downstream datasets. Meanwhile both ATLAS and ATLAS + FiCL scores reported in your paper use those 3B/11B base models directly.

So the reason why the numbers reported in this work do not match any of the numbers in the original ATLAS paper is because almost all of the numbers in the ATLAS paper are FT. The only exception would be the 0-shot results (e.g. table 7). For that, the numbers aren't exactly the same either? (47.1 vs. 47.4), and that's because I assume you ran eval again and got slightly different numbers? Or is the dataset slightly different? Or prompt/post-processing slightly different?

(as a general comment: while you stated you will add more explanations, I think the main thing missing right now is a clearer distinction between this work and ATLAS, and may reduce the impression of it being ""too incremental"" as reviewer SfUy wrote. The extra page you'll get would be helpful towards this, and can help lift some of the appendices and analysis into the main paper while keeping Sec 3.1 in if you really insist on it.)

[Authors]: Thank you for your follow-up questions!

Yes, your understanding is correct. All the few-shot results reported in the ATLAS paper are from finetuning (FT) performance. In our paper, all results are from in-context learning on the base models, as we want to disregard FT since FT is not the common few-shot usage nowadays. This is also a significant distinction between these two papers, i.e., finetuning vs in-context learning.

Regarding the 0-shot results of ATLAS, we ran the evaluation ourselves. There is a slight difference in the prompt. In their code, they add a space between ""Answer:"" and ""<extra_id_0>"", but we found there is no such space in their template for pretraining, so we removed it (i.e., ""Answer:<extra_id_0>"", see our prompt in Appendix B5). Therefore, our reported 0-shot results of ATLAS are slightly higher than the number in the original paper.

Thank you for your suggestion. The rebuttal is limited to 2500 characters, so we need to keep the above response precise to cover all of your questions. Feel free to let us know if you would like any additional explanation. We did a lot of work to shorten this paper to 9 pages, lol. We will definitely use the extra page to incorporate your suggestions in the final version.

[Reviewer_A7yJ]: Thank you for the response. 

I'm still not convinced by the findings/strength of the current section 3.1 -- if it is intended to be the first analysis for ICL for these models, then it should definitely be expanded to additionally include C.1 and C.2, and there would be 3 (equally important) subquestions, which together inform the design of RAVEN. With extra space, this may be possible, but may also require condensing the existing 3.1 a little (perhaps the discussion of ""effect of number of in-context examples"" can be reduced, since the findings there aren't too unexpected: that there's some threshold at which ICL plateaus.

For FiCL, I'm re-reading this section trying to recall what [k,m] referred to again, and I'm a little confused by Table 2. In table 2, how many docs are retrieved (i.e. what is n)? As a comment, it would be helpful to illustrate or re-use the variables k, m in Figure 4 too.

(I'll leave this comment here for now so authors get a chance to respond, but will look more closely at this section later).

[Authors]: Thank you for your feedback and suggestions! Appendices C.1 and C.2 were initially part of the main text, but we moved them to the appendix to keep the paper within 9 pages. We plan to move them back to Section 3.1 in the final version. We will also take into account your suggestions for adjusting the space of other content.

For FiCL, [k, m] refers to [k-shot, m-fusion]. Using Figure 4 as an illustration, it's [j-shot, 2-fusion] (there are j in-context examples in total, and the encoder encodes 2 examples each time). We will make it more clear (e.g., replacing j with k to be consistent and adding more explanations in the caption).

For the number of retrieved docs (i.e., n), as detailed in Appendix B.1, it was set to 40 by default.

Thank you for carefully reviewing our paper and considering our responses. We greatly appreciate it and are happy with the feedback. We are also more than happy to answer any additional questions you may have.

[Reviewer_A7yJ]: Thank you for answering the questions.

I think there is already enough substance in this paper, however I still find FiCL an interesting approach and this paper only scratches the surface of what is possible. It would be an even stronger paper with a more thorough study on FiCL specifically to learn why it helpful: this study explores the three parameters [k, m, n], but to me, it feels like there are 4: [k, m, num_docs, num_encodings], where currently it is assumed each doc gets a single encoding. But if the argument is that fusion specifically helps with aggregating over more ""shots""/examples, then something like [64, 5, 1, 40] should strongly improve over [1, 1, 1, 40] or more realistically, [1,1,1,1]. That is, 64-shot, 5 sampled randomly 40 times for a *single* document, then fused should outperform one-shot with no fusion (still 1 doc) -- this hypothetical but be a little degenerate but something like [64, 5, 10, 40] vs. [5, 5, 10, 40] would be a more reasonable setting to demonstrate and ablate between whether it's the diversity of examples or the fusion mechanism itself which leads to performance gains.

Nonetheless, I am increasing my score slightly upon the authors' response which answered my confusion around the ATLAS eval, and their committal for clarifying the relation between this work and ATLAS, and on expanding Section 3.1.

[Authors]: Thank you for highlighting FiCL and offering your thoughts! This is a very interesting point for further analysis. We really appreciate the engagement and responsibility of the reviewer—this is incredible.

[Reviewer_gDcV]: Thanks for the authors' response! I'm sorry for being confused. Let me try to clarify my questions. From my perspective, ICL is not a very common practice for RAG due to the following concerns: 
- **Effectiveness:** I haven't seen many cases where ICL contributes substantially to RAG, though it's useful in many other situations. If there are examples where it does, please remind me. 
- **Running cost:** Applying RAG is already costly due to the encoding of retrieved information. Introducing ICL will add considerable extra costs.

As a result, I still cannot agree with the motivation of the paper, though it made meaningful progress in improving upon Altas.

[Authors]: Thank you for your feedback! We would like to further clarify and strengthen our response to your concerns.

> Effectiveness of ICL in RAG:

The motivation for using ICL with retrieval is aligned with its application in models without retrieval. In most cases, retrieval just adds external knowledge to the model's context but does not fundamentally change the task being performed. If ICL can work on tasks for a model without retrieval, there is no reason why it should not be applied to a model with retrieval. Both ICL and RAG are important and common usages of LLMs; they are orthogonal and don't conflict with each other. Therefore, there must be many use cases of ICL with retrieval, such as answering a factual-seeking question with the help of examples, solving knowledge-intensive tasks with the help of examples, writing a passage (which may require retrieval to collect the knowledge) based on some examples, etc. And empirical evidence in our paper exactly demonstrates that ICL enhances performance in models with retrieval on popular tasks such as Open-domain QA and MMLU.

> Running Cost of ICL:

While it's true that ICL introduces additional costs, we designed our approach to minimize these costs effectively. Here are the key points regarding cost management:

- **Efficiency in Prompt Design:** In our implementation, we do not retrieve passages for in-context examples (i.e., only retrieve passages for the target query). Therefore, the additional tokens introduced by ICL in our setting are the same as traditional ICL.

- **Linear Cost Growth with FiCL:** The computation cost of FiCL grows linearly with the number of in-context examples, as it performs self-attention over one (or $m$) example(s) at a time. This is more efficient than decoder-only LMs, where the time complexity is quadratic. This efficiency allows us to leverage the benefits of ICL without incurring prohibitive costs.

In summary, our paper provides strong empirical evidence and methodological innovations that support the use of ICL in RAG settings, demonstrating meaningful performance improvements without incurring unsustainable costs. We believe that these contributions are significant and address both the effectiveness and cost concerns you raised. 

We hope our response addresses your concerns. Please let us know your thoughts, and we are more than happy to answer any further questions.

[Reviewer_gDcV]: Thanks for the authors' response! I'm increasing my overall assessment to 6 after having calibration with other papers in my batch. I think the paper basically presents a quality study in this field.  

However, I'm still uncertain about the necessity of using ICL for RAG. The improvement can be very marginal with the latest LLMs whereas the additional cost from using ICL will be substantial. The authors may provide a comprehensive investigation in their future research.

[Authors]: Thank you for your feedback! From the developer's perspective, we do believe there are many use cases for ICL in RAG, and we have observed significant performance improvements in our experiments. The cost of ICL here is also not high (the FiCL design even makes it cheaper than traditional ICL).

Thank you for agreeing with the quality of our study! We think one interesting future exploration is to apply our methods to more advanced encoder-decoder LMs, such as Reka (though it’s not open source so far)."

1097,CALM : A Multi-task Benchmark for Comprehensive Assessment of Language Model Bias,Accept,TB7fW4y3pZ,,,,"[Reviewer_SNfb]: Thanks for your answers. I still find some of the conclusions stretched.
For instance, I explicitly mentioned this one:
“for OPT series, larger model means more bias: This is only true if you ignore the smallest OPT which has by far the largest bias in this series. The other differences may not even be statistically significant.” 
but the authors did not comment on it. 
To be clear the smallest OPT model has a bias score of 24.5 versus all the other models have scores between  11.6 and 15.0. This strongly undermines the conclusion that larger parameters lead to larger bias.

The author response also does not address several of my other comments, for instance:
- ""If a model is unbiased, its score for each group should match the baseline, resulting in a bias score of 0%."" => I'm not convinced this is the case. 
-  it is suggested that T0's lowest reported bias score could be due to its training procedure, but here too dataset content seems to be a more natural explanation

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for their comment. We provide further explanation below.

Regarding trend in OPT series, we agree that OPT-1.3B has a higher bias and doesn’t follow the upward bias trend. In the paper, we mentioned this in paragraph 4 of section 3 and we claim for OPT models to have higher bias trend with growing model size from 2.7B to 30B parameters. The point we are trying to make is that bias scores can increase with increasing model sizes. We are not trying to state that all OPT series models follow the upward bias trend. We apologise for any confusion and will make the text clearer to avoid any confusion in the camera-ready version.

Regarding the statistical significance of the upward bias trend from 2.7B to 30B version, we believe that a 29% jump in bias scores (11.6 for the 2.7B vs 15.0 for the 30B) is statistically significant as we argued in the rebuttal. To make it clear, we consider all differences higher than 10% (relatively) to be statistically significant based on our extensive experimentation in Table 3. During our analysis, we did not draw any conclusion whenever the bias differences were less than 10% (relatively). The results we observed for upward bias trend in OPT models from 2.7B to higher parameter models is consistent with observations by Helen et al [1].

Regarding “unbiased model having 0% bias score”, please note that while we are measuring a group accuracy on a smaller set of instances, the only difference with other subsets is change of name in our setting. In an ideal scenario, we would expect models (which are completely unbiased) to generate responses which are not affected by change of names. This reasoning of the expectation of 0% bias scores in unbiased models is consistent with other related works on bias datasets [2,3,4]. We understand that this might seem unrealistic to some readers and we will tone down this sentence to state that we expect the model to have similar accuracy on all subsets.

During our experimentation, we tried our best to ensure that all the models evaluated have not seen any of the datasets before. Specifically, in the case of T0, only DuoRC (which is <1% of our dataset) was part of training of the T0 series of models. This ensures that there was no prior data contamination which could have significantly impacted our analysis on T0. While, we accept that there might be other factors apart from training procedure which can have resulted in lower bias scores in T0 models, but the bias scores for T0 models are significantly lower than any other tested model series and we believe their training procedure definitely contributed to this lower bias score.

We hope our responses have addressed the reviewer’s concern and we would be very happy to provide further information. We hope the reviewer will consider our work to be impactful and useful for the community, and will reconsider evaluation of their score.

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for their comment. Our understanding is that the usage of term instruction tuning in the current LLM training paradigm is very different from the training procedure used in T0 models. T0 models were trained on a large set of datasets such as WikiQA, IMDB [1]. These datasets were from a variety of different tasks such as QA, summarization etc. To combine different datasets in a single format, the authors added some basic instructions to the prompts such as “Replace the _ in the above sentence with the correct option” [2]. The model was trained only once on this large corpus of datasets [1]. This usage is different from the current LLM training paradigm, where in most cases the training happens in two stages. In the first stage, there is a base model trained on a large corpus of unlabeled data, followed by an instruction-tuning step where models are trained on a set of instructions to give a specified output. In T0 model training, there is no separation between base model and instruction-tuning step. Thus, we mentioned earlier that we did not use any instruction-tuned models.  We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and totally understand that this might be confusing for some readers. We will explicitly mention that the training procedure for T0 models is different from other tested LLMs in camera-ready version. Additionally, to have a fair evaluation between different models, we use in-context learning using 5-shot examples following the approach adopted in HELM [3].

[Reviewer_Zsmu]: Thank you for answering my questions.
Even if a thorough qualitative analysis is out of scope of the paper, it’d still be good to include examples of more examples of resulting data for each dataset. Although the authors mention that they conducted multiple rounds of filtering to select a diverse set of samples, I’m not convinced this is a good dataset by looking at the examples in Figure 1 and Table 1. 
I’ve the same concern with Reviewer SNfb25 that bias score differences could just be due to noise. 

One way to test it is to use a subset of male data as female and vice versa (resulting in computing scores for male vs male, and female vs female) and check if average bias scores for these are close to 0 for all models.

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for their comment. We ran the experiment suggested by the reviewer. We experimented with 2 models - Llama-2-7B and Falcon-7B. For each model, we performed 4 runs. In 2 runs, we compared performance on a randomly selected subset (20 and 25 male names) with the entire male names set (comparing male vs male scores). For the other 2 runs, we compared performance on a randomly selected subset (20 and 25 female names) with the entire female names set (comparing female vs female scores). For the Llama-2-7B model, we observed an average bias score of 0.3 and for the Falcon-7B model, we observed an average bias score of 0.25. This shows that there is minimal noise in our dataset. Please note that for our analysis, we consider all differences higher than 10% (relatively) to minimise the impact of noise in our metric. This number came from our extensive experimentation in Table 3. We thank the reviewer for suggesting this experiment and this definitely adds value to our paper. We will include this new experiment in camera-ready version.

We will add more examples for each dataset in the appendix for a better understanding and will also make all templates accessible along with dataset information in our code release. We hope our responses have addressed the reviewer’s concern and we would be very happy to provide further information. We hope the reviewer will consider our work to be impactful and useful for the community, and will reconsider evaluation of their score.

> The improvements are limited according to Table 2

We agree that *performance* improvements over Llama 2 70B in Table 2 are small. However, the improvements in terms of *parameter count* are fairly substantial. For example, S3 on average selects an LLM with 0.71 of the Llama 2 70B parameters, which can reduce the inference cost, while providing some performance improvements.

We also note that the results in Table 2 are for the most challenging scenario when new tasks have no labeled data. In Figure 2 we show that the performance gains from selecting LLMs with our scores can be further increased when a few labeled samples from the new task are available.

> No human evaluation, I think there might at least be one to generally prove that the proposed method could predict the quality of a LLM’s output as expected.

HELM tasks are amenable to automatic evaluation and do not require human evaluation. For the MixInstruct (open-ended instruction following) experiments in Section 5.2, we used the metrics proposed by the dataset's authors [1]. Although they did not perform human evaluations—which we agree could strengthen the empirical findings—they verified that the considered automatic evaluation metrics correlate well with scores obtained using ChatGPT.

[Authors]: Yes I'm happy to explain. I initially wrote up an explanation of how to interpret the plot for the initial rebuttal but had to cut it due to the character limit on the COLM OpenReview.

To explain the plot with an example: for MMLU we are able to make reasonable predictions about the point of emergence using models trained with ~10^22 FLOPs, but not with fewer than 10^22 FLOPs. The first post emergence model on MMLU was trained with ~5*10^22 FLOPs, hence we are able to predict 4-5x the FLOPs in advance on this task. For GSM8K, we can do the same calculation; we take the earliest successful prediction and the first post-emergence model and the FLOPs comes out to about 4x. Though there is one failed prediction in between the successful predictions on GSM8K; this failure can likely be corrected by running additional fine-tuning runs on different data subsets, as discussed in Section 5. We will clarify this in the paper and include some additional analysis to this effect. Overall, the figure is meant provide visual clarity and detail regarding the claims in Section 4 about how far in advance we are able to make emergence predictions (e.g. 4x the FLOPs in advance / 2x the FLOPs in advance).

1073,An In-Context Learning Agent for Formal Theorem-Proving,Accept,sN2xzVSVMT,,,,"[Reviewer_BSYj]: I very much appreciate the authors' clarification. However, I am still concerned about the comparison between COPRA and the baselines (ReProver and Proverbot9001), where GPT-4 has been used to compete against small (or even none-LM based) models. Both ReProver and Proverbot9001 can be deployed locally, while GPT-4 is still too expensive. I am worried the advantages of COPRA might be diminished once ReProver and Proverbot9001 use stronger models. By the way, you can consider Graph2Tac (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02949) as a baseline in Coq, which is more recent and easier to adapt to LLM settings. Additionally, is the significant performance drop from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 solely a result of the difference in context width? While I am open to the use of GPT-4, I would like to see a more comprehensive discussion on the specific model requirements for COPRA, as well as the feasibility of implementing COPRA using open-source or more academically accessible models.  Given the reasons outlined above, I will keep my rating unchanged.

[Authors]: Thank you for your comments. We would like to address some of those below:

**Question:** Comparison between COPRA and baselines with smaller models.

**Answer:** ReProver and Proverbot9001 are finetuning approaches and require training before use. For COPRA style use, it will need training on the feedback (error signals) data which is hard to generate. In general, in NLP, there has been a shift from finetuning to ICL. The power of ICL in theorem-proving is, in our opinion, a fundamental topic of interest to the COLM community. Open models are improving rapidly -- GPT-4 scale open models are not necessarily that far away.

**Question:** Is the significant performance drop from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 solely a result of the difference in context width?

**Answer:** We believe that the drop from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 is possibly because of the context window but also possibly because of the differences in the larger pretraining set. That said, we have thoroughly analyzed our results and found no evidence of leakage. Therefore, there seems to be a jump in the theorem-proving capabilities, and this is an intriguing phenomenon that the COLM community is well-positioned to study more deeply.

**Question:** Feasibility of implementing COPRA using open-source or more academically accessible models?

**Answer:** We evaluated COPRA on CodeLlama 2 (see Table 1) which is open for academic usage. This proves that our approach is agnostic of the underlying model. We show that using COPRA we could boost the performance of few-shot CodeLlama from 0% to 5.73%, which means the novel stateful backtracking search helps regardless of the underlying model. However, the performance is not comparable to GPT-4 because CodeLlama is a less powerful model. We would like to reiterate that open models at the level of GPT-4 are likely to be available in the future due to the rapid progress of the open-source community. For example, we can potentially incorporate a baseline where Llama 3 is used as the foundation model driving COPRA in subsequent revisions.

We would like to thank you for pointing out Graph2Tac, we were not aware of this work and we will cite it. We note that this is a fairly recent work, and we can include it as a baseline in subsequent revisions."

[Authors]: Thank you for your comment. We would like to address your concerns as follows:

**Comment:** “Standard practice for self-improvement that leads to lack of novelty.”

**Response:** We go beyond just including the error response. The error message is incorporated with a stateful backtracking search. Statefulness helps avoid repeating similar mistakes and helps prune the search space further. Apart from the error message on the last step, the proof steps that were incorrect for the particular state are shown in the prompt, this reduces the search space dramatically, and triggers backtracking if the LLM chooses to repeat the same incorrect step. The stateful tracking of errors allows us to identify proof steps that eventually fail even while executing immediately which further helps in backtracking early and changing the direction of proof. We have included an example of this in the response to your next comment.

**Comment:** “ReProver uses DPR why BM25 works better in COPRA than ReProver”

**Response:** Retrieval helps get the useful lemmas needed to complete a proof, but the tactic prediction model needs to know the right way of using them. The model may fail to predict the right arguments for the lemma, and the proof search may fail despite the retrieval being correct. The ReProver paper doesn’t perform an ablation on how the quality of the retriever impacts its ability to do proofs. It studies the quality of the DPR vs BM25 retriever in terms of MRR but doesn’t have any ablations where ReProver uses BM25 instead of DPR for proof search, so it is hard to know the impact of the quality of retrieved results on the overall proof search.


For the example in Fig. 6, we had the following prompt just before GPT correctly predicted the next proof step:

```

It is easy to see that to be able to capitalize the well-retrieved lemmas, the models need to learn how to use those lemmas as well. In our case, BM25 does a very good job of retrieving the best lemmas, however, GPT-4 could not use it correctly in the first couple of tries. It was only because of our **novel stateful backtracking** approach that we could capture the previous mistakes along with the last error message all in the same prompt which dissuaded the GPT-4 from making repeated mistakes and getting to the right prediction. It is also important to note that we could not solve this problem without retrieval, but once we know the list of relevant lemmas, knowing how to use them becomes extremely important. Given this example, it should not be surprising that even when DPR performs better than BM25, COPRA has an edge because it can act as per the rich feedback it gets from the environment. Another interesting idea one can try is to let COPRA create a search query to control the retrieved lemma, which can make a simple BM25 search more effective than DPR.

[Reviewer_Ub88]: Thank you for your response. I noticed that your paper highlights stateful backtracking as a significant contribution. However, this approach appears similar to traditional planning methods in reinforcement learning. Additionally, recent works like Reflexion and Reasoning as Planning also employ a comparable strategy of using intermediate reasoning steps or checkpoints for self-improvement/planning. Could you clarify how your work differs from these methodologies?

[Authors]: Thank you for your comment!

Yes, like other work on LLM agents, we are inspired by traditional planning/RL. However, the use of LLMs puts us in a very different space in terms of capabilities. Specifically, while traditional symbolic planning and deep RL have been used for theorem-proving in the past, they haven't been able to scale to the kind of problems that Copra can solve.

It is true that the idea of LLM agents is also explored in efforts like Reflexion. However, the theorem-proving setting opens up some specific opportunities that the approaches you mention do not exploit. Specifically, formal proofs are driven by a rigorous ground-truth specification (the theorem's statement) and can offer detailed error messages explaining the failures of specific actions, and the Copra agent makes use of these. Also, the stateful backtracking search used in Copra is carefully designed to exploit specific characteristics of the theorem-proving setting (for example, we retain information about actions that failed in the past) and is more sophisticated than the sampling-based search in methods like Reflexion.

[Reviewer_BSYj]: I very much appreciate the authors' clarification. However, I am still concerned about the comparison between COPRA and the baselines (ReProver and Proverbot9001), where GPT-4 has been used to compete against small (or even none-LM based) models. Both ReProver and Proverbot9001 can be deployed locally, while GPT-4 is still too expensive. I am worried the advantages of COPRA might be diminished once ReProver and Proverbot9001 use stronger models. By the way, you can consider Graph2Tac (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02949) as a baseline in Coq, which is more recent and easier to adapt to LLM settings. Additionally, is the significant performance drop from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 solely a result of the difference in context width? While I am open to the use of GPT-4, I would like to see a more comprehensive discussion on the specific model requirements for COPRA, as well as the feasibility of implementing COPRA using open-source or more academically accessible models.

[Authors]: Sure! In short, the traditional gradient checkpointing computes 1 normal forward, 1 recomputation forward, and 1 backward. Because FlashAttention recomputes the attention again in its backward kernel to avoid rematerializing the big softmax matrix (i.e., being I/O-aware), the FlashAttention backward equals one recomputation forward plus 1 normal backward.

1043,From Words to Numbers: Your Large Language Model Is Secretly A Capable Regressor When Given In-Context Examples,Accept,j9hEPsGrdM,,,,"[Authors]: Dear Reviewer,

We will provide an expanded discussion on the rebuttal.

(1) Regarding the novelty, we argue that the novelty lies in the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, it has been unknown that off-the-shelf LLMs can do regression reasonably well, just by giving them in-context examples, without any additional training. While the task of regression with transformers and in-context exemplars has been studied in previous work, they all trained the model for the specific task at hand. Here, we show that capable LLMs already emerge with an underlying in-context learning algorithm that is capable of learning the regression task on-the-fly. 

We believe that the observation the off-the-shelf LLMs perform well even on synthetic datasets is a significant finding in itself and can pave the way for future work to: (i) better understand the limits of in-context learning, and (ii) develop better LLM-based approaches for regression. Other potential avenues for future work include: (i) adding synthetic regression data during pre-training to improve the in-context learning algorithm; and (ii) testing how well LLMs use their context by evaluating their performance on synthetic regression tasks, where the error should predictably decrease with more examples if the LLM is indeed capable of using all its context well.

As you have acknowledged in your review, while domain adaption of LLMs has been studied, this work essentially works without any domain adaptation. We believe this is a novel observation.
> Domain adaptation of LLMs for in-context learning has already been studied in several works (Garg et al 2022, etc), and this work essentially works without any domain adaptation

Regarding the impact of which 50 in-context exemplars are selected, we repeat each experiment 100 times and report the average. Each time, we select train/test exemplars. Therefore, we argue that our results are robust and representative.

We discuss higher-dimensional datasets in (2). Regarding their applicability to more complex datasets, we would like to remark that our analysis encompassed the Friedman benchmark datasets. We leave the exploration of other datasets to future work.

(2) Regarding higher-dimensional datasets, we believe that techniques typically used for feature selection could be effectively applied to LLMs as well. Although we agree that this remains to be proven, this can be a potential area for future research. Given the current manuscript's length of approximately 50 pages with the additional results, we leave this for future work.

Our primary goal was not to propose LLMs as replacements for traditional regressors. Instead, we showed that LLMs are capable of performing regression, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. We want to emphasize that off-the-shelf LLMs performing well even on lower-dimensional datasets is a significant finding in itself.

We did not claim that LLMs would necessarily perform well on higher-dimensional datasets. Our focus was on showing their potential in lower-dimensional scenarios, which we believe is significant in itself. Furthermore, while high-dimensional datasets are indeed common, there are many practical datasets with a modest number of features where our findings remain highly relevant.

For example, on UCI datasets, there are 478 regression datasets ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets?skip=0&take=10&sort=desc&orderBy=NumHits&search=&Types=Multivariate)). Out of those, there are 136 with less than 10 features ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets?NumFeatures=0-10&skip=0&take=10&sort=desc&orderBy=NumHits&search=&Types=Multivariate)) and 206 with a number of features between 10 and 100 ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets?NumFeatures=10-100&skip=0&take=10&sort=desc&orderBy=NumHits&search=&Types=Multivariate)). Counting the ones with less than 20 features (inclusive), there are over 225 such datasets, just under 50% of the total number of datasets. 
Therefore, even if LLMs might not generalize well to high-dimensional data (although this is not certain), there are still a large number of datasets that fall well within their realm of applicability.

Lastly, we would like to emphasize that the contributions of this work should not be readily dismissed by speculation on how it would work in settings not investigated or mentioned in the paper.

(3) We used exactly the same examples as for LLMs. The training of the baselines has been handled by sklearn with its default values, which are battle-tested and should provide a good start for most practitioners. Similarly, we did not perform any tuning for the LLMs either. All methods were used without any tuning to ensure a fair comparison. We will add more details in the Appendix B, where we describe the models we used. We also investigated in ""Is It Just Better KNN?"" (Appendix K) with a large number of different KNN variants. For example, Claude 3 Opus always outperform all 70 variants of KNNs we investigated.

(1) Please refer to our comment ([link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LzpaUxcNFK&noteId=EZ3Xl5zZan)). We included 5 additional real-world datasets. 

(2) We do not expect overfitting to be problematic in the regime of an increasing number of examples. Regarding overfitting in general and how it affects in-context learning vs traditional methods, we believe this is an interesting question, but it is outside the scope of the paper (which already grew to ~50 pages with the additional results and experiments). We explore in Appendix L (Figures 31,.., 35) how the performance of GPT-4 compares with Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and LR + Poly when given more examples (20 <= x <= 500). We observed that GPT-4 behaves “normally”, in the sense that its performance improves with the number of examples at least as well as the other methods. 

Additional evidence that the LLMs are capable of leveraging can be found in the literature [1, 2].


(3) We would like to remark that this paper has not intended to be an explanation on why ICL works in general or why it works for regression. We included in the revision an extended abstract in the Appendix, expanding on the papers included in the Related Work, some of which attempt a theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism. We would like to highlight that even though in-context learning took off with GPT-3 and many papers attempted to explain it [3, 4, 5, inter alia], the exact mechanisms at play in real-world LLMs, such as the ones we used in this work, are still not fully understood [6].

Furthermore, we want to emphasize that the primary focus of our paper is on exploring the extent to which transformers can perform regression, rather than providing a theoretical framework for in-context learning (ICL). 
We believe that our findings can be helpful for a future theoretical framework, as it further describes what transformers can do. The fact that off-the-shelf LLMs are capable of performing regression has not been previously known.
This discovery is particularly surprising because it is not limited to proprietary models like GPT-4 and Claude 3; it also extends to open-weight models such as Yi 34B, DBRX (Appendix), and Mixtral 8x22B (added in the Revision). This suggests that, perhaps, once an LLM reaches a certain level of capability, it might universally acquire the ability to perform regression, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. 

In our paper, we hypothesize that LLMs emerge from their pre-training as highly capable online meta-learners. This capability may explain their ability to perform a wide variety of tasks, including some that were not encountered during their pre-training phase, such as our original regression datasets. This hypothesis motivated the exploration in Section 5.

[Authors]: Thank you for raising your score and engaging with us!

We would like to further elaborate on the motivation of this paper.

Understanding the underlying mechanism of In-Context Learning (ICL) has spawned many recent works. Importantly, these works predominantly train a model specifically to do ICL. We complement these works by exploring the performance of off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLMs) without any further training. This is important for the following reasons: (i) ICL emerges in LLMs without them being specifically trained for it, and (ii) it is more practical, as practitioners will typically use off-the-shelf LLMs rather than training one from scratch.

Furthermore, as you noted in the ""Reasons to Accept"" section of the original review, our work broadens the understanding of their potential uses and could streamline analytics processes in various fields.

In other words, the motivation of this work is to further enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play in ICL. We expand upon previous work aimed at improving our understanding of ICL by investigating it under a more realistic scenario, with off-the-shelf LLMs."

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer,

We will provide an expanded discussion on the rebuttal.

(1) Regarding the novelty, we argue that the novelty lies in the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, it has been unknown that off-the-shelf LLMs can do regression reasonably well, just by giving them in-context examples, without any additional training. While the task of regression with transformers and in-context exemplars has been studied in previous work, they all trained the model for the specific task at hand. Here, we show that capable LLMs already emerge with an underlying in-context learning algorithm that is capable of learning the regression task on-the-fly. 

We believe that the observation the off-the-shelf LLMs perform well even on synthetic datasets is a significant finding in itself and can pave the way for future work to: (i) better understand the limits of in-context learning, and (ii) develop better LLM-based approaches for regression. Other potential avenues for future work include: (i) adding synthetic regression data during pre-training to improve the in-context learning algorithm; and (ii) testing how well LLMs use their context by evaluating their performance on synthetic regression tasks, where the error should predictably decrease with more examples if the LLM is indeed capable of using all its context well.

Thank you for your reply and for raising your score! We appreciate your engagement with our work and your constructive comments.

We included a table with the average ranks across various types of datasets to summarize the results more concisely. We will include a similar table in the manuscript. 

More concretely, we show below a comparison between a subset of the models we used:
- LLMs: 9 large language models (LLMs), both open and private:
    - Open: DBRX, Mixtral 8x22b, Mixtral 8x7B
    - Private: Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, GPT-4, GPT-4 (20240409), Chat GPT, Gemini Pro
- Traditional Supervised Methods: 5 traditional methods:
    - Linear Regression + Poly, Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests
- Unsupervised Methods: 3 unsupervised methods:
    - Average, Random, Last


We attached the table below (sorted by Overall). 

| Model Name | Average Rank Across Linear Datasets (6 datasets) | Average rank Across Original Datasets (5 datasets) | Average Rank Across Friedman Datasets (3 datasets) | Average Rank Across NN Datasets (2 datasets) | Average Rank Across Non-Linear Datastes (10 datasets) | Overall (16 datasets) |

| Last| 16.50 | 16.4| 16.66| 16.5| 16.5| 16.50|


For example, Claude 3 Opus achieves an average rank of 2.5 on linear datasets, better than Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or KNN, and only behind Linear Regression and Linear Regression + Poly. 
Similarly, it achieves an average rank of 3.6 on non-linear datasets, outperforming all the other methods in this comparison. Moreover, Claude 3 Opus achieves the best overall rank, outperforming all the other methods. Overall, at least in the settings we investigated, the LLMs indeed prove to be capable of regression.


We acknowledge that there are open questions regarding the limits of LLMs in regression tasks, such as whether their strong performance is restricted to specific conditions like a small number of examples or dimensions. However, these questions should not detract from the merits of our findings. Instead, they highlight potential avenues for future research that our work enables. 

We believe that future LLMs could perform even better on regression tasks for the following reasons:

- (i) Synthetic regression data might be included during pre-training to enhance the in-context learning algorithm.
- (ii) Synthetic regression tasks could help evaluate how well LLMs leverage their contexts, with the expectation that error rates should predictably decrease with more examples if the LLMs can effectively use their context (therefore, performing well might become a target)

[Authors]: We will provide our thoughts on this below.

We understand your concern regarding the perceived over-claiming in some parts of the paper. Our intention was to highlight the surprising capability of LLMs to perform regression tasks, even if they do not always outperform traditional methods. The fact that LLMs can consistently outperform unsupervised baselines (Random, Average, Last) demonstrates their ability to handle regression tasks. Furthermore, we compared between LLMs and 70 variants of KNNs (Appendix K, expanded in revision). These KNN Regressor variants were created by modifying: (i) number of neighbors, (ii) weights (uniform or weighted), (iii) p.
We added our conclusion in the bullet point below. We argue that this is further evidence that the LLMs can, indeed, perform regression. 

- We observed that except on Friedman #1, for every other dataset, the top 9 best performing models are all LLMs. In other words, both closed-source models (e.g., Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4) and open-weights models (e.g., DBRX, Mixtral) outperform all KNN models on all the datasets except Friedman #1. This suggests that the mechanism implemented by in-context learning might be something more complex than KNN.

Lastly, a low number of dimensions (i.e., $<10$) is reasonably common in practice. For example, from the UCI repository, there are 136 such datasets out of a total of 478 ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets?NumFeatures=0-10&skip=0&take=10&sort=asc&orderBy=NumInstances&search=&Types=Multivariate))


To summarize, the reasons we do not think this is overclaiming are: (1) The above experiment, comparing LLMs against 70 variants of KNNs, where the LLMs consistently outperform **all** KNN variants, (2) In almost all situations, the LLMs outperform our unsupervised baselines, (3) In many situations the LLMs outperform traditional supervised methods (Claude 3 Opus, for example, ranks 1st overall). While there might be certain settings where the LLMs will consistently under-perform even the unsupervised baselines (although we did not find any such examples), we believe that their strong performance, at least within the limits of our experimental setting, justifies the claim that they are indeed capable of regression. We believe this is a surprising and important observation.

Nevertheless, we are open to revising the section names if there is consensus among the reviewers/AC that they may be perceived as over-claiming."

[Authors]: Thank you for the suggestions. We would like to address the following:

* The computation cost of the cross-attention layer depends on both the input (source) sequence length and output (target) sequence length, i.e., the attention matrix is not a square matrix. Because the output sequence length is usually short compared with the input sequence length, the computation cost of the cross-attention is only a fraction of the computation cost of the input self-attention. For example, the input length can be up to 16k in the experiments, while the output sequence length is only 128. That is, for the input self-attention, the size of the attention matrix is (16k * 16k), while for the cross-attention, the size of the attention matrix is only (16k * 128).

* Here are some results of S4+Full-attention. We can see that performance of S4+Full-attention is only slightly better than S4+Local-attention, but the computation cost is much higher.

I am already positive about the paper, but I have some concerns that the response does not sufficiently address.
* The concern about this Section 5.2 is not addressed in this response. In general, appropriately increasing the width of the beam search will result in better performance than the greedy search or excessively large beam size, and the fact that this phenomenon has been reconfirmed for DPO policy does not support that DPO is implicitly learning a value function.

[Authors]: **The concern about this Section 5.2 is not addressed…**

We are working on evaluating a PPO-trained model under beam search for the same dataset and will report results as soon as they are available. As stated by the reviewer, a-priori we also expect performance gains in PPO policies with beam search. The goal of Section 5.2 is not to explain the performance gains of BS, but rather to show the equivalence of value-guided search in LLMs (which has driven a lot of research interest recently) to likelihood-based search (at least in the RLHF domain), of which BS is an example. We empirically show similar performance gains with simple BS as reported in prior works with value-guided decoding, without actually training a separate value function. 

**The connection between Section 5.3…**

The expectation in Eq. 14 is implicitly taken over the sequence of tokens induced by the reference model, but we believe the reviewer is right and this result also holds in a bandit interpretation where the corresponding expectation is over the prompt distribution."

Prompt-responses are truncated to 512 tokens and we train for one epoch using the RMSProp optimizer. Gradient norms are clipped to 10. We then run DPO using batch size 32 (each example is positive and negative) again with 2 gradient accumulation steps. We use the same learning rate and truncation for DPO. For DPO we use beta = 0.1.

2. We will qualify the credit assignment portions of the draft to further indicate that we are using qualitative (not quantitative) analysis and that the existing evidence is anecdotal in Section 5.1.

I have increased the overall rating from 5 to 6.

Your results on GSM8K are encouraging. However, I still think designing critics based on a dataset is not the most convincing way because we cannot know what type the user query belongs to in a real system. I know it is hard, but trying to think out of specific tasks and find more fundamental critics (or letting the model identify by itself) could make the system more helpful in real applications.

[Authors]: Thank you for your feedback!

Our current work focuses on analyzing LLM reasoning, and constructing an automatic reasoning chain evaluation metric, even though tailored to several reasoning datasets, takes a concrete step towards this objective (e.g., it helps reveal the novel conclusions in Section 5).

We recognize the importance of developing an evaluation or reward model for general purposes. Such a model remains a goal for our long-term research efforts, and we are dedicated to advancing towards it. For example, a natural next step of AutoRace would be using human feedback to learn a better criteria list that applies to general real-world applications."

We have dedicated ourselves to thoroughly addressing all your concerns and questions in the rebuttal. Could you please spare a moment to review our response? We are eager for your feedback and prepared to provide any further clarifications.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

[Reviewer_rws2]: Thanks for clarifying my comments. Most of my questions are clarified with your detailed response. Can you shed some light on how accurate auto-race annotations are?

[Authors]: Thank you for your feedback!

The average accuracy of AutoRace is 0.86 (from the experiment results in Table 1). This is higher than the best baseline, which achieves an accuracy of 0.82. Moreover, AutoRace is the only method that performs within 5% of the best results across all six datasets, showing outstanding robustness. For more experimental results and detailed analysis, please refer to Section 3.2 in the paper.

We are happy to answer any further questions you may have.

[Reviewer_rws2]: Thanks for the prompt reply. Let me clarify the question. In Table 1, AutoRace performs better than human reasoning in some instances. That is why I was asking how accurate the basis of judgment is. Can you explain why  AutoRace can be better than a human evaluator in some instances?

[Authors]: In Table 1, we didn't compare AutoRace to human evaluation. In fact, we use human evaluations of reasoning chains as the **ground truth labels** (True/False) in the experiment. Instead, we include **`answer-based evaluation`** as a reference in Table 1. 

---

""Why can AutoRace be better than **answer-based** evaluation in some instances?""

Answer-based evaluation evaluates reasoning chains solely based on whether the final answer matches the ground truth answer, disregarding the correctness of the intermediate reasoning steps. This can lead to the **false positive** problem (as demonstrated in Figure 1, a), where a reasoning chain might conclude with a correct answer but be supported by faulty reasoning. In contrast, AutoRace is specifically designed to assess the reasoning process by applying learned evaluative criteria.

The additional experiment addresses my concern about the sample efficiency of AutoRace. However, I noticed an interesting phenomenon in the new result, where providing more incorrect reasoning chains to GPT-4 does not yield a consistent gain (at least for 2/6 datasets). Do you have any explanation for that?

[Authors]: Thanks for your reply!

One possible reason is that the criteria list constructed by GPT-4 given more examples includes some general criteria, such as `relevant to the question` . These criteria may not be specific enough to help improve evaluation. How to make use of more examples to consistently improve evaluation accuracy remains an interesting problem, and we plan to explore it in future work. For example, it's possible to use a small validation set to select the best composition of criteria, or even find the best criteria list with some tree search algorithms [1].

[Authors]: With a larger sample size, the results of GPT-4 are now 78.0% ± 2.6% vs. 77.7% ± 1.9% respectively with and without search on FaVIQ, and 57.3% ± 1.6% vs. 56.8% ± 1.9% with and without search on X-Fact.

As a minor comment: It's still not clear to me what you mean with 'unstable' (what is your definition of it?)

[Authors]: Thank you for considering our response and revisiting your rating!

We said ""unstable"" in the sense that it does not give stable performance across variations that one would not expect or desire to damage performance (most notably, using a significantly stronger LLM). Both you and Reviewer NQTb found this unclear, however, so it is probably a poor choice of words. We will revise it to say more directly ""its performance is mixed, having worse results with GPT-4 than GPT-3.5, and a high rate of not outputting an answer as requested.""

Here are some additional results and responses to more of your original points:

1. We've run Claude 3 Haiku as main agent and found it gives promising results, achieving 71.3% ± 6.6% F1 on LIAR-New with Cohere search. This is roughly equal to GPT-4 as main agent.

2. We have done analysis on how many search queries and reasoning steps (not including search results) on average that the LLMs go through, and how they relate to correct answers. Some of the key results on LIAR-New include:

| model | Incorrect Reasoning | Incorrect Search | Correct Reasoning | Correct Search |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| vicuna |	4.3| 	1.2| 	4.2| 	1.1| 
| mixtral |	5.4	| 1.7	| 4.8	| 1.4| 
| gpt-3.5 |	4.7 | 1.4 |	4.5	| 1.2 | 
| gpt-4 |	3.9| 	1.2	| 3.8	| 1.1| 
| haiku |	4.2	| 1.6	| 4.3 |  1.6 | 

GPT-4 does the least reasoning, on par with the least search, and the least number of total tokens. This might suggest it is more efficient and can rely more on its superior knowledge base and reasoning. Conversely, Vicuna, with approximately tied least search and second lowest reasoning steps per example, may be providing poor performance because it does not take enough advantage of search to compensate for its insufficient reasoning or knowledge.

Mixtral and Haiku clock in with the most search and reasoning steps. GPT-3.5 falls in the middle. Potentially, Haiku is able to achieve performance near GPT-4 by combining both a stronger model than GPT-3.5 and Mixtral, and above average amounts of search and reasoning.

Across nearly all models, more search and more reasoning steps are used for incorrect predictions than correct ones. This is a bit counterintuitive and could indicate either that these examples are the most complicated, or are ones where the models are struggling to find the right information and searching repeatedly. Either case could point to a way to improve results in future work.

We also plan to do an experiment replacing the final predictive step of Vicuna with GPT-4 and vice-versa, thus feeding each model the search queries and intermediate reasoning of the other, which should help answer which part of the process is key to performance. Unfortunately, this result will probably not be completed in time for the discussion period.

3. The point about the plus and minus PF results being run on GPT-3.5, where the impact of search was less pronounced, makes sense. As noted in response to another review but missing in original response to yours, we've now run Duck -PF with GPT-4. In this case, we do find performance decreases somewhat, from 70.3% ± 8.5% to 66.9% ± 6.5% with k=10. However, it remains much better than no search. With k=5 it decreases to 64.7 ± 4.3, and 63.7 ± 3.4 with k=2, following the trend observed with GPT-3.5.

As before, thank you for your time and we'd be happy to discuss if you have further thoughts.

[Authors]: Update on results on other datasets: with a larger sample size, the results of GPT-4 are now 78.0% ± 2.6% vs. 77.7% ± 1.9% respectively with and without search on FaVIQ, and 57.3% ± 1.6% vs. 56.8% ± 1.9% with and without search on X-Fact. Thus, search appears to yield a performance improvement but only slight on these datasets. This is nonetheless a positive result because retrieving evidence with greater or equal performance provides its own benefit, since it enables citing sources and providing users followup materials. We hypothesize that the performance benefit is low because many questions in these datasets appear too easy to the model. Specifically, we observed the model explicitly saying search was not necessary on some examples, and the rates of search are very low compared to LIAR-New: 0.54 and 0.61 average queries for FaVIQ examples it got correct and wrong, and 0.45 and 0.43 on X-Fact, contrasted with more than 1 query per example average on LIAR-New.

4. In general, if you feel there are any key works our findings reinforce and we should include, we would be happy to add discussion and references. Regarding the point about “no single source” in particular, we felt that it was important to verify that our approach works without searching PolitiFact. In some cases there are existing fact-check articles to draw on, but in other cases there are no such sources, and we sought to develop a method that worked in both scenarios. This type of analysis has been omitted in some literature like HiSS (open web) and the many papers that draw on Wikipedia (fixed and not necessarily comprehensive knowledge base). It is reasonable though that more sources should be helpful up to a point. Also, it may be that the reason using a stronger summarizer performs better (Table 5) is that it is better at reconciling conflicting sources like you highlighted; more broadly, this would be an exciting topic for future work.

5. The claims are generally atomic to the extent that they have verdicts from professional fact-checkers and are commonly evaluated with binary labels (e.g., true/false). In particular, LIAR-New is sourced in nearly the same way as the very widely used - and widely used with binary labels - LIAR dataset; it just includes more recent examples. Likewise, FEVER v2 is also commonly evaluated with binary labels. Therefore, our approach follows standard practices to facilitate comparison between methods.
We found that although not explicitly instructed to do it, our method naturally leads the LLM to decompose its analysis through multiple steps of reasoning and multiple searches. For example, the interaction shown in Table 1 is evaluating the statement “Comparing the price of oil and gas in June 2008 to March 2022 shows that oil companies are ‘price gouging.’” We see in Table 1 how it searches for 2008, and then after that (not shown in Table) it searches for 2022. We will add some examples and clarify the writing in the paper.

6. We have now added class-wise precision and recall to the appendix. Please let us know if there are any particular cases you would like to see here.

7. We have adjusted the writing to include forward referencing, better font size in Fig. 1, and description of the plus/minus margins. The latter are 95% confidence intervals over 5 runs.

Thank you again for your time, and as before would love to hear your thoughts on these changes or any other feedback you may have!"

**Regarding the CoT Setting**

I hope you can show the results for NQ and TQA because running an inference and reporting the results does not take too much time, as far as I know. Moreover, from Figure 6 in your paper, you've already done some experiments on NQ and TQA, which suggests it is not too hard for you to run and report these results.

**Regarding Domain Knowledge**

Cross-document evaluation (where the documents are still from the same dataset) may not be enough to demonstrate that the model has gained generalizable domain knowledge. I highly recommend adding at least one cross-dataset experiment to strengthen your claims.

[Authors]: We would like to thank the reviewer for spending time replying to us. We have some new results below: 

**CoT Setting**: We ran some additional ablation on the CoT for NQ and TQA and reported the results below. As the reviewer mentioned, we see a slight degradation of CoT compared to non-CoT settings (but roughly the same number). This might be because the TQA and NQ tasks focus on citing the answering text from the context above without much reasoning involved. We want to say that given the results are very similar, adding CoT is still in general helpful in the settings where the reasoning is heavily involved. However, this indeed is an interesting finding, we will clarify this in the paper and add a discussion on this. 

NQ: CoT: 49.10%; Non-CoT: 50.90%         
TQA: CoT: 62.77%; Non-CoT: 64.77%  

**Domain Knowledge**
We managed to run some ablation on how the knowledge can be generalized between datasets. We have three anonymous figures here. In this setting, we train on NQ/TQA/Hotpot and test on News QA/Squad QA/Web Questions. We found that RAFT can indeed generalize to new domains as well. In the figure, we mainly study how the percentage of the golden documents ($p$%) included in the training dataset will affect the generalization performance. The curves demonstrate that domain generalization can mostly benefit from a training dataset of 100% golden documents, as remembering the knowledge in one domain won't necessarily help another.

In the figure, we mainly study how the percentage of the golden documents ($p$%) included in the training dataset will affect the generalization performance. The curves demonstrate that domain generalization can mostly benefit from a training dataset of 100% golden documents, as remembering the knowledge in one domain won't necessarily help another.

990,Does your data spark joy? Performance gains from domain upsampling at the end of training,Accept,0ATnyCisBs,,,,"[Reviewer_1SzL]: Thank you for your reply.

I can see that your work aims for a broad performance boost, whereas an approach targeting the adaptation to a specific domain does not care about anything else than the target domain.

I am not so sure, I understand what you mean by annealed vs. non-annealed model. As I understand it, you fix your pretraining budget in your work, and then you decide how much percentage of that budget is used for upsampling certain domains. You could see [1] as a radical variant of this, upsampling a formerly unseen target domain dataset from 0 to 100 and radically downsampling everything else to 0. The pretraining budget, of course, would be the combination of (in the case of [1]) RoBERTa's original pretraining PLUS the domain adaptation.
The scope of your work is certainly different, but the underlying mechanisms look very similar. You say yourself that similarity of the upsampled domains are probably responsible for the performance gains on different benchmarks.

I encourage you to explain these connections and differences carefully (also to other works focussing on domain adaptation like [2] and [3] brought up by reviewer nKUf) and am otherwise confident that it is justified to keep my high score as is.

[Authors]: We're using the term annealed vs. non-annealed model to refer to whether we are starting with a model with the learning rate decayed vs. changing the data mix in the middle of the learning rate schedule.  For example, if you start with RoBERTa or a Llama-2 model, the checkpoint is at the end of the learning rate decay which we refer to as an annealed model and thus continued pretraining typically begins by doing learning rate warm-up. In our case, we have access to the checkpoints before decay which we refer to as a non-annealed model.

We have found that when working with non-annealed models, large domain shifts such as switching to only the domain specific datasets can harm performance.  (As discussed in our response to Reviewer nKUf, we found in early experiments that completely removing Common Crawl resulted in a 17 pp drop in the language understanding category of the Gauntlet.  We will be adding this experiment to the appendix.)  In contrast, continued pretraining with annealed models has been successful with just domain specific data as in [1].

We will add text to explain the connections and differences carefully as requested by the reviewers."

[Authors]: Thank you very much for reading our response and raising the score. We are keeping running the suggested experiments and will add them to the final version of the paper. 

We also finished another robustness test on WebShop. Similarly to the previous experiments on ALFWorld, we added irrelevant information and misleading information to the distilled knowledge. For example, we insert the action “rate [Item]” and tip “You can rate the items and leave feedback” which are not valid in the environment and can be misleading. We add these distractors to every skill-conditioned policy, so that it is a strong perturbation to the original method. In this way, we can simulate the case where the LLM hallucinated in the discovery and distillation process. The resulted success rates with GPT-3.5-0613 are as below.

- Original O3D: 35%
- O3D + Irrelevant Info: 31%
- O3D + Misleading Info: 34%

Compared to the baseline ReAct whose success rate is 27%, our O3D still achieves higher performance even when distractors exist. There suggests that **Stage 3 of O3D is robust to noise or mistakes from the first 2 stages, if any.**

In addition, we also would like to emphasize that **our algorithm design makes the first 2 stages grounded on facts in offline trajectories, so that the skills, actions and tips are relatively reliable.** Such design includes iterative discovery and distillation, trajectory contrasting, as well as segmentation-based skill summarization. For example, instead of asking the LLM to think what is the mistake and how to fix it (a common reflective method) which may lead to hallucination, we ask the LLM to compare a success sub-trajectory and a failure sub-trajectory and find their differences. In this way, it is much easier for the LLM to locate the key to success in the environment. 

We hope the above experiment results and explanations have addressed the reviewer’s concern on the quality control and robustness of the method. Please let us know if there is any remaining question or concern. We are very happy to discuss further. Thank you again for your time and suggestions."

[Authors]: Thank you for following up on this point. Sorry if we were not clear, but the point we are trying to make isn’t that the metric we mentioned is somehow highlighting any ambiguity with the approach (“inconclusive” was a poor word choice), but rather that the metric is simply not a very relevant way to evaluate the quality of the approximation. To clarify the issue here more formally, taking the first case, where both models share a tokenizer:

Let $f( y )$ be the map from model A’s embeddings to model B’s embeddings, and $g( x )$ be the map from model B’s embeddings to model A’s embeddings. Since these are maps across discrete spaces, the traditional concept of a gradient does not apply. We therefore briefly considered a metric that looks at the behavior of the FUSE gradient. This metric was based on the similarity between the identity matrix and the jacobian of the map from model A’s embeddings to model B’s embeddings and then back to model A’s embeddings:

$J_{f \circ g}( x ) = I$.

This can easily be evaluated as: $J_{f}( y ) J_{g}( x )$. Where $J_{f}$ and $J_{g}$ are the Jacobians of f and g respectively. In section 3.1, we propose an approximation to $J_{f}$ and $J_{g}$ as $V_{B}^{+} V_{A}$ and $V_{A}^{+} V_{B}$ respectively, where $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$ are the discrete input embedding spaces of model A and model B. We can then show the following about the Jacobian:

$J_{f \circ g}( x ) = J_{f}( y ) J_{g}( x ) = V_{B}^{+} V_{A} V_{A}^{+} V_{B}$. 

This equation is the identity matrix if we can take the true inverses $V_{B}^{-1}$ and $V_{A}^{-1}$. However, one of the properties of the pseudoinverse is that if $A A^+ = I$ then $A^+ A \neq I$ or the other way around depending on the size of the row/column spaces. Therefore: 

$V_{B}^{+} V_{A} V_{A}^{+} V_{B} = V_{B}^{+} V_{B}$. 

This is not equal to the identity matrix. As $V_{B}$ approaches a full-rank matrix, the pseudoinverse becomes more like a true inverse, and $V_{B}^{+} V_{B}$ becomes closer to the identity. We know ahead of time that the embedding matrices are not full rank, so $J_{f \circ g}( x )$ will never be the identity. 

Measuring the quality of the approximation in this way becomes a function of the ranks of $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$. This metric would effectively be reporting the ranks of the embedding matrices, which we do not believe provides useful information when determining the quality of the gradient approximation."

I'm still not convinced as to why DPO was chosen to train the verifier as opposed to a simple contrastive objective such as $\log({\sigma(r(y^+)) - \sigma(r(y^-))})$ as was used by Khalifa et al, and others. My intuition is that this will perform just as well as DPO if not better. I believe this is a crucial baseline.

[Authors]: Thank you for your further comments.

Our main contribution is training verifiers using negative data generated during the self improvement process. As such, how we train verifiers is an empirical choice and depends on several factors such as using full or parameter efficient fine-tuning. Nevertheless, we compared two methods of training verifiers: (1) ORM (Cobbe et al, 2021) which corresponds to reward modeling combined with SFT, (2) DPO. Empirically, we found that when using LoRA, DPO results in better verifiers for GSM8K and comparable on MBPP, as shown in Figure 5.

That said, V-STaR can be instantiated with any approach for training verifiers, and we have launched verifier training with contrastive loss used by Khalifa et al, as we believe it would make our work stronger!

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer THgs,

We would like to thank you again for your detailed reviews. 

In short, we added comparison with self-evaluation based on your suggestion, transferability of verifier to Mistral 7B on GSM8K, and addressed your concerns about using other models.

We would be happy to do any follow-up discussion or address any additional comments.

Taking into account the transferability of the verifier, which is beneficial for the scalability and applicability of the method, I have revised my score to 6. However, the self-evaluation experiments are not convincing. My initial thought was to not use the verifier that you trained at all, but to use the self-evaluation of the model itself as the verifier.

[Authors]: There might be some confusion about our self-evaluation results. 

As mentioned by the reviewer, we ignored the verifier indeed and used the self-evaluation of the model (which we call generator), using the log probability of generated solution under the model, to score 64 solutions and pick the one with highest self-evaluation score. We found that doing so (self-eval@64) was better than pass@1 performance but worse than using the verifier (verifier@64) to pick the solution. Here, our generator correspond to running STaR for 3 iterations (and does not involve the verifier). 

Hope this clarifies the results we reported in the rebuttal. Please let us know if you were thinking something else for the self-evaluation baseline.

[Reviewer_THgs]: Thank you for the further clarification and explanation. This addresses some of my concerns about the self-evaluation experiments. I would probably still suggest including experiments comparing to other standard baselines (like Tree-of-Thought or Self-Evaluation Beam Search) in the next version."

We’d include these results in the revision and post here as well if the experiments finish in time."

## Evaluation 

I understand that the purpose of the paper is not about evaluation. However, it is difficult to claim that you improve diversity without measuring it. It is true that this lack of a good evaluation framework, is a more general question, and maybe beyond the scope of this paper. Like for clustering in ML, this is an issue. 

## Cross entropy
My comment was not as clear as I wanted (and maybe too short). My concern on this part is the following: The equation does not emphasize the key differences of your proposition. Moreover the  surrounding text does not help neither. I recommend to modify this part.

In my opinion, I still believe that the paper is not fully convincing as it is. However, I can raise my score to 5."

[Authors]: Thank you for your response and for increasing your score, as well as for suggesting we compare with Knowledge Editing methods. To address your concerns, we evaluated some of these methods on our GRE task. Here, we use the definition of the new concept for editing and also present support sequences in-context. IKE [1] uses in-context learning for knowledge editing, whereas ROME [2] and MEND [3] update the model weights. To train MEND, we use the zsRE dataset and we use the implementations provided in EasyEdit [4]. In the first table below, we provide only support sequences in-context and in the second we also provide definitions.

We find that knowledge editing methods score better than our Prompting baseline in some cases, when the definition is not provided in-context, but around the same or slightly worse when it is provided. In either case, CoLLEGe achieves much higher accuracy than all KE methods. 

We also tried using the support sequences as well as the definition during editing. Unfortunately, the time it took to evaluate ROME in this setting was much longer, and we were only able to complete 2 evaluation runs (as opposed to 5 above). Nonetheless, we found that performance was sometimes a bit worse than if we just use the definition for editing. As above, in the first table we provide only support sequences in-context and in the second we also provide definitions. In both cases, definitions and support sequences are used for editing.

[Authors]: During the evaluation, we noticed that KE methods took much longer to evaluate than CoLLEGe. To quantify this, we computed the average amount of time each method took on each GRE evaluation example, which we present below. CoLLEGe and Prompting + CoLLEGe are 7x and 3x, respectively, faster than the fastest KE method, MEND. CoLLEGe is also 50x faster than the slowest method, IKE. One caveat is that we are using the implementation of these methods from EasyEdit and did not separately optimize their efficiency.

[Authors]: We appreciate your response. Due to the limited space (2500 characters), we respond to the main questions in our rebuttal. Here, we take the opportunity to further address your concerns.

**Potential Biases of GPT-4 Generated Questions**

Thank you for pointing out this issue. We will add the below clarification as a limitation.

```
We acknowledge that relying on GPT-4 to generate instances for evaluation can lead to potential biases, in particular data homogeneity [1, 2]. Although we enrich the input pattern with additional domain information and evaluate their level of diversity by calculating the Distinct score [3], there still remains a potential problem that queries under the same pattern and domain can be similar to each other. This problem can be solved by decomposing the current patterns into more fine-grained and detailed sub-patterns, or providing larger domain text as a source for query generation, which we leave for future work.

**More Related Work**

We will add more discussion on recent studies, in particular those focusing on dataset augmentation and creation using LLMs. For example:

```
Recently, researchers have explored using LLMs as annotators for creating and augmenting data of their interest, using both zero-shot and few-shot learning[1, 2]. For example, [3], [5], [9],[11], and [12] use LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 to label raw text for text classification tasks, and [6] and [13] use LLMs to generate output texts for text generation tasks, such as machine translation and text summarisation.  Additionally,  [4] finetunes GPT-2 with small data to annotate new training data for text classification tasks. [7], [8] and [10] use LLMs to augment dialogues with few-shot learning. Our work falls in the above studies that use LLMs for data augmentation. However, different from those that mostly use LLMs to augment analogous data or label output text, we use LLMs to obtain diverse queries for a specific task under the guidance of patterns (instruction) generated by LLMs themselves.
```

Also, we thank you for the reference [14, 15]. We would add relevant discussion in our revision. For example, in Sec 4.4 (Evaluation protocol): 
```
As merely relying on GPT-4 to evaluate model response can be less effective [14, 15], we evaluate model performance by comparing their responses and gold responses.
```
And in Appendix A:
```
[14, 15] show that although LLMs can show superior performance compared with humans, they can have limitations in basic tasks.  
```
and
```
[15] use LLMs to generate complex and multi-constrained instances, by drawing on common-sense reasoning. Compared with them, we focus on more general QA-format tasks.

**Specific Prompt and Prompt Changes**

In our early experiments, we find that GPT-4 did not behave as we expected. For example, we find that GPT-4 can summarize patterns that are very simple (e.g. ""GPT-4 can fail on QA tasks"") and do not contain detailed features. Thus, we add more specific instructions to guide GPT-4 to generate patterns that suit our goal: it should describe in what situations GPT-4 can fail, and it should be understandable by humans. 

However, once our prompts are set, we do not optimize them during the iteration of pattern evaluation (generating new queries) and optimization, i.e., ```there were no iterative changes to the prompts```.

We hope that this discussion could address your concerns. Please let us know if you have any further questions and we are happy to engage in further discussion."

[Authors]: Due to the limited space (2500 characters) for rebuttal, we respond to the main questions. Here, we take the opportunity to engage further discussion.

**Evaluation metrics**

Following [1], we modify our evaluation prompt, asking LLMs to explain why the model-generated response is correct or not [1], and then give a label for the response. In particular, the evaluation prompt is:

```
Please first read the below question, its correct answer and a model-generated answer:

Question: {question}

Correct Answer: {answer}

Model-generated Answer: {model_response}

Please explain whether and why the model-generated answer is correct or incorrect and add a tag \""correct\"" or \""incorrect\"" at the end of your response.""
```

Similarily, we show the precision, recall, and f1 scores of this metric by comparing its outputs with the human-annotated labels. 

On full 1835 instances. Precision 94.57, Recall 78.06, F-1 85.52
On 115 instances. Precision 90.57, Recall 73.85, F-1 81.36

We see that compared with direct prompting, asking LLMs to first generate an explanation and then a label gives higher precision and lower recall and F-1 scores. We assume that this can be because the LLMs can generate inappropriate explanations for those questions (in particular those questions are challenging to LLMs),  and subsequently give a wrong label. 

For example, given the question: 

```
Suppose there is a rule that patients with Long QT syndrome can only participate in sports with a prime-numbered amount of players on the field. If a patient wants to join a sports team where the number of players is doubled each season, which sport should they choose to maximize their chances of participation in the first three seasons?
```

And the GPT-4 answer is:

```
To maximize the chances of participation in the first three seasons, we need to find a sport where the number of players on the field is a prime number in each of the first three seasons. Let's denote the initial number of players as x. Then, the number of players in the first three seasons will be x, 2x, and 4x.

We need to find a value of x such that x, 2x, and 4x are all prime numbers. Let's analyze the possibilities:

1. If x is an even number, then 2x and 4x will also be even numbers. The only even prime number is 2, but if x = 2, then 2x = 4, which is not a prime number. So, x cannot be an even number.

2. If x is an odd number, then 2x will be an even number. As mentioned earlier, the only even prime number is 2. However, if 2x = 2, then x = 1, which is not a prime number.

Based on this analysis, there is no sport that meets the criteria of having a prime-numbered amount of players on the field for the first three seasons when the number of players is doubled each season.
```
which is correct as labeled by both human and our evaluation metric. 

However, the above prompting evaluation gives an explanation:

```
​​The model-generated answer is incorrect. The explanation provided by the model is accurate in stating that if x is an even number, then 2x and 4x will also be even and therefore cannot be prime (except for the number 2). However, the model then incorrectly states that if x is an odd number, then 2x will be an even number and cannot be prime, which is true, but it incorrectly concludes that there is no sport that meets the criteria.

The fundamental error in the model-generated answer is the assumption that there could be a prime number x that, when doubled or quadrupled, results in other prime numbers. This is impossible because, except for the number 2, all prime numbers are odd, and multiplying an odd prime number by 2 or 4 will always result in an even number greater than 2, which cannot be prime.

The correct answer clearly states that it is impossible for x, 2x, and 4x to all be prime numbers because 2x and 4x will always be composite if x is greater than 2. Therefore, there is no sport that meets the criteria of having a prime-numbered amount of players on the field for the first three seasons when the number of players is doubled each season.

Incorrect
```
where the explanation incorrectly reasons ```the model then incorrectly states that if x is an odd number ... will always result in an even number greater than 2, which cannot be prime.```

We will include the above case and result as a supplement material in our revision.

**Potential Biases of GPT-4 Generated Questions**

Thank you for pointing out this issue. We will add the below clarification as a limitation.

```
We acknowledge that relying on GPT-4 to generate instances for evaluation can lead to potential biases, in particular data homogeneity [1, 2]. Although we enrich the input pattern with additional domain information and evaluate their level of diversity by calculating the Distinct score [3], there still remains a potential problem that queries under the same pattern and domain can be similar to each other. This problem can be solved by decomposing the current patterns into more fine-grained and detailed sub-patterns, or providing larger domain text as a source for query generation, which we leave for future work.

**More Related Work**

We will add more discussion on recent studies, in particular those focusing on dataset augmentation and creation using LLMs. For example:

```
Recently, researchers have explored using LLMs as annotators for creating and augmenting data of their interest, using both zero-shot and few-shot learning[1, 2]. For example, [3], [5], [9],[11], and [12] use LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 to label raw text for text classification tasks, and [6] and [13] use LLMs to generate output texts for text generation tasks, such as machine translation and text summarisation.  Additionally,  [4] finetunes GPT-2 with small data to annotate new training data for text classification tasks. [7], [8] and [10] use LLMs to augment dialogues with few-shot learning. Our work falls in the above studies that use LLMs for data augmentation. However, different from those that mostly use LLMs to augment analogous data or label output text, we use LLMs to obtain diverse queries for a specific task under the guidance of patterns (instruction) generated by LLMs themselves.
```

Also, we thank you for the reference [14, 15]. We would add relevant discussion in our revision. For example, in Sec 4.4 (Evaluation protocol): 
```
As merely relying on GPT-4 to evaluate model response can be less effective [14, 15], we evaluate model performance by comparing their responses and gold responses.
```
And in Appendix A:
```
[14, 15] show that although LLMs can show superior performance compared with humans, they can have limitations in basic tasks.  
```
and
```
[15] use LLMs to generate complex and multi-constrained instances, by drawing on common-sense reasoning. Compared with them, we focus on more general QA-format tasks.

I still believe that the experiments should be conducted on more diverse data and models, as you mentioned as a limitation. However, since my main concern was partially addressed, I've updated the overall rating from 5 to 6.

945,How Susceptible are LLMs to Influence in Prompts?,Accept,BY3QEc3rRu,,,,"[Reviewer_9RHV]: Thank the authors for their rebuttal and the clarifications regarding certain points that I raised. 

Regarding different advocates, the authors provided additional experiments on Llama-2 models of different sizes as advocators or judges. I appreciate the additional results, but my question was more focused on the different model architectures (Llama/Mistral/Falcon/ect.) instead of model sizes. 

My concerns on the significance/impact of this work remain, where 1) I still consider the findings to be somewhat less surprising as LLMs are autoregressive models and will be affected by prompts and 2) the issue can be mitigated in many ways but not discussed or explored in this paper. If I understand correctly, the scope of this paper is to bring attention to existing issues of LLMs.  The analysis is indeed interesting but the finding itself does not seem surprising or difficult to deal with.  

I increased my rating accordingly with the efforts that authors made during rebuttal.

[Authors]: Thank you very much for your continued engagement in the discussion and for allowing us to clarify our position further.

**Other models as advocates**

We agree that it would be interesting to explore other models as advocates. In our original experiments, we focused on *Llama-2* because we found it to be the most “compliant” with our request to generate explanations for incorrect answers. Specifically, while models like *Falcon* and *Mixtral* occasionally refused to create explanations for incorrect answers, this was not the case for the *Llama-2* model. We point to a brief discussion on this topic in Appendix A, Section “Generated Explanations”. For further details, we also refer to our response to reviewer LLEW.

---
**LLMs are affected by prompts**

We agree with the reviewer that the fact that LLMs are influenced by prompts is not by itself surprising. After all, these models are notorious for their in-context learning [1]. Our work aims to highlight the degree of this influence when opinions are presented in the prompts. We found that models are overly relying on these opinions presented, leading to substantial performance deterioration. This is particularly significant as these models are increasingly being used as judges in various evaluation frameworks [2, 3].

---
**Mitigation techniques**

Our experiments reveal that while LLMs are indeed influenced by the content of their prompts, standard prompting techniques do not effectively mitigate this influence. Specifically, neither chain-of-thought nor few-shot prompting resulted in a significant reduction in this effect. This is a critical highlight of our paper. We believe that exploring alternative approaches, such as fine-tuning, may offer more promising results in reducing this influence. By bringing this phenomenon into the spotlight, we hope to encourage further research on effective mitigation strategies in this area.

[Reviewer_D4ia]: We have to admit that the concurrent work [1] is more preferred and mature, because it 1) involves more solid theories, 2) is motivated by a concrete attack goal and corresponding threat model, and 3) is published several days earlier than this submission. I consider this work concurrent to [1] and my decision is independent to 3.

I still do not feel the properties proposed in this work pose a solid threat to LLM, but they are interesting properties to NLP community (probably worth discussing in COLM). I would suggest improving this work to form a solid attack, but considering the timing, I am not against the work to be published to COLM for the awareness of such threats in NLP community."

[Authors]: Thank you for getting back to us so quickly and giving more details about your concerns. Here is some additional relevant information.

1. Yesterday COLM organizers clarified the related work policy in an email to reviewers and authors:
> Related work concurrency: we follow the NeurIPS policy with regards to concurrency and related work. Papers appearing less than two months before the submission deadline are generally considered concurrent to NeurIPS submissions. **Authors are not expected to compare to work that appeared only a month or two before the deadline.**

2. Both OpenAI and Cohere (not sure about others) were vulnerable to our method when we wrote the paper. OpenAI changed their API in response to becoming aware of the attack. Cohere's API was patched around the same time, presumably for the same reason. These responses indicate that these companies take our findings seriously. **In terms of longer term impact, API providers are now aware of the vulnerabilities going forward and will design their interfaces with this in mind.**

Do these additional details address your concerns?

902,Source-Aware Training Enables Knowledge Attribution in Language Models,Accept,6DhLcMJ3Cr,,,,"[Reviewer_a1pn]: I would like to thank the authors for providing a thoughtful response. I think the authors have addressed my concern on real world data, though I would prefer to see if only adding instruction SFT is able to let a pre-trained LLM output doc ids for a subset in its training data.

However, I would like to maintain my score due to the two following concern: 
- As the model size gets larger and larger, we might not need this kind of effort to solicit the model to output doc ids, since it can memorize more. 

- I know that not many people have resources to train a 1.1B model, that is why I think more lightweight methods with just SFT or preference optimization on off-the-shelf LLM (e.g. LLama3) would be more impactful. As you have mentioned in your abstract, you introduced a ""**post** pre-training recipe"", which somewhat indicates that this can be applied to any **pre-trained** LM.

Again, I think that the author did well in addressing some my concerns (synthetic v.s. real data), and I think the paper is novel and well written. But I still want to maintain my score due to the computational requirements and scalability of this method. It would make this paper much stronger to see if only adding doc ids to a few trusted sources and applying this method only during SFT to off-the shelf models.

[Authors]: Thank you for taking the time to respond to our rebuttal.

> As the model size gets larger and larger, we might not need this kind of effort to solicit the model to output doc ids, since it can memorize more.

Recent advances has shown that memorization even for larger models is challenging. For instance, LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 still suffer from citation hallucination [1,2]. As we argue in the introduction, this is mainly because their pretraining throws away useful metadata information such as document hyperlinks or URLs, and which our work aims to make use of via principled doc ID injection into the pre-training data.

> I know that not many people have resources to train a 1.1B model, that is why I think more lightweight methods with just SFT or preference optimization on off-the-shelf LLM (e.g. LLama3) would be more impactful.

Pure SFT or preference optimization could only get you so far if the model has no knowledge of the document IDs it should cite. In other words, SFT/Preference optimization can not train a model to cite a document whose ID it has not seen before, and scaling SFT/preference optimization to all pretraining data will be at least as computationally expensive as our approach. 

Lastly, our approach is a post training (fine-tuning) recipe that is applied to an already trained TinyLlama model rather than requiring much more expensive training from scratch.

We hope our response above has addressed your concerns.

[Reviewer_a1pn]: Thank you for the response.

I think that your response have partially resolved some of my concerns. It is true that even ChatGPT / GPT-4 can hallucinate citations. My point was not if we scale up, the model will not hallucinate. My point is that larger models are able to memorize more, and it is easier to elicit larger models to spit out its training data. However, there is one point that I overlooked: even if the models are able to provide verbatim quotes, we still don't know the origin of the sources, which is what the proposed method aim to solve.

On the second point, I would like to raise that it might not be necessary to produce cites on **all pre-training data**. Producing cites on few trusted sources (e.g. wikipedia) is able to improve the trustfulness of model generations by a significant amount.

Since there is a point that I overlooked and I believe it is important to produce not just quotes, but also cite sources, I would like to raise my score (5 -> 6).

[Authors]: We are curious to hear reviewer Xq2X's response to our rebuttal. We dedicated a significant amount of time to address the issues concerned from their review. As written in our rebuttal, we believe that the two main points addressed in 'reasons to reject' were clarified sufficiently: As for point 1, we have explained why we don't think that our results are biased, and we nevertheless ran additional experiments to substantiate this. As for point 2, again, there were no model configuration and sampling parameters to discuss. Considering the clear deviation in reviewer Xq2X's score compared to the other reviewers, we believe it would be fair to hear a response to our rebuttal before the deadline.

[Reviewer_Xq2x]: I would like to thank the authors for their detailed response and the additional analysis. I appreciate that an additional set of paraphrases was generated with an independent model (i.e., one that is then not evaluated on the paraphrases). Based on the reasons provided, I would expect this to be the default experimental setup as it would exclude potential biases occurring from evaluating a model based on data that it generated. However, given that this would substantially change the reported results, this would exceed the scope of a revision after reviews. 

Re. the parameters: I appreciate the clarification and agree that in this case no additional information would be required (misunderstanding on my side).

I also appreciate the additional limitations provided. 

Based on the above I increased my score, but still believe that the paper would benefit from an additional round of revision."

[Ethics_Reviewer_2Duz]: While the paper does mention a politically-charged group (e.g., Antifa) and use this as one topic to study model generations, the presence of this content, in my view, does not create or raise substantial ethical concerns.

To improve the paper's ability to contribute towards the broader literature with adequate safeguards, the paper could, perhaps, benefit from a statement acknowledging the potential dual use of these methods and potential harms related to manipulating the sentiment of LM generations.

[1] Backdooring Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models with Virtual Prompt Injection, Yan et al, NAACL 2024

[Authors]: Thank you for your response and for acknowledging the parts where we have addressed your concerns. We understand that your remaining concern is the number of explored models (we experiment with FLAN-T5 XXL, 11B) and algorithms (where we use Best-of-N). While we agree that having even more results is always nice, we believe the number of experiments we have conducted has merit. Nevertheless, we will expand on this in the limitations section of the camera-ready version. We would like to elaborate on our arguments from the rebuttal:
1. Our attack does not pose any assumption on the model architecture or training algorithm. Any model that can be trained with BoN or RL can be attacked in our setup. Our results (Figure 6) show that BoN successfully increases the reward over the course of training, and other reward-optimization algorithms (e.g., PPO and DPO) should yield similar trends.
2. We show comprehensively the effectiveness of our attack. We explore 6 entities paired with 2 sentiments on 2 popular datasets (e.g., HH-RLHF has been downloaded from HF 163k times in the last month alone). Therefore, to conduct the main experiments, this results in running the BoN algorithm 24 times (each including 4 rounds of fine-tuning of the 11B model). Moreover, we also extensively explored the poisoning of the Reward Model. For this, we explore the same setups plus even more configurations, including the number of poisonous samples, mixing strategies, and model size (Table 1 and Table 9).
3. It is common in the data poisoning literature to reduce the number of models and datasets to understand the attack dynamics better. Particularly when poisoning RLHF this is reasonable since two models are involved (LM and RM) compared to supervised fine-tuning, where only a single model is poisoned. Concretely, Yan et al. [1] also only explore a single 7B model (Alpaca) on one dataset, despite their attack using supervised fine-tuning. The most related work to ours, Wang et al [3], explores a single 7B model with a single RLHF algorithm (PPO) on one dataset (PKU-SafeRLHF); Rando et al [2] explore a single model with two sizes (7B and 13B) with a single RLHF algorithm (PPO) on one dataset (HH-RLHF).

Re ""discriminator""

In my opinion, the term ""reward or preference"" model explains things well. I didn't see the necessity of using ""discriminator"" here.

Re ""Section 6.1""

Without comparing to Figure 5, Figure 6, the Contrastive Distill particularly, doesn't show clear benefit from online updates. It would be great to explain why the policy model still improves in this condition.

Re ""T_p""

Please include the corresponding experimental results.

Re ""OPO w/ gold""

In the paper, the authors explain that OPO (gold): only online gold preference labels are used to update the policy. Doesn't OPO (gold) adopts perfect reward function during training since it's online? I may misunderstand gold/silver preference data, but as I mentioned before, clarity needs improved.

I prefer to keep my original judgement.

[Authors]: Thanks for following up! We definitely agree that clarity of the original version needs improvement, and have been working on a much clearer version (especially on explanations of the algorithm and data condition) based on your feedback. 

> Section 6.1

We also found it interesting that contrastive distillation seems to improve despite having lower overall reward accuracy than other tasks. It’s worth noting that in standard RLHF, even on large datasets, RMs are known to have low (~60%) accuracy.  Our hypothesis is that the noisy features reward models learn do, in aggregate, correlate enough with the true objective for optimization to succeed, and the online setting helps this feature learning in aggregate. Referring to Figure 3 (comparable with Fig 6), note that the beginning and the end of policy training (where Fig 6 shows highest stable accuracy) is where policy improvement occurs the most, which makes sense.  

> T_p 

We can include more complete results in a future version. Some reference results (high T_p means more online): 

Word collector: 
- T_p=2000 ->  max R ~=20
- T_p=500 ->  max R ~=17.9
- T_p=8 ->  max R ~=15.3

Contrastive Distill: 
- T_p=400 ->  max R ~=0.7
- T_p=20 ->  max R ~=0.2

Nouns: 
- T_p=200 -> max R ~=49 (with 200 gold prefs)
- T_P=20 -> max R ~=49 (with 600 gold prefs)

 > OPO w/ gold

This is an important thing we’ve tried to improve clarity on in our new version. We can explain further: for example, in OPO w/ gold, we may sample 32 preferences in a step, and label these with the gold reward function. With D2PO, we also get 32 gold labels, and can update the policy on these, but since we have an RM, we can *also* generate 128 (or more) new outputs on fresh prompts, and get more preference labels using the RM, without needing any new gold labels. This thus gives DPO its advantage in gold preference data efficiency."

Other re-initialization scheme: in response to pLrB, they mention taht FOCUS only applies to MLMs (multilingual models).  While that was the focus of that paper, I do believe the method would work just the same in the current paper's setting and so could be another good comparison.

A lot of my comments and their replies require a non-trivial amount of writing, e.g. improved results discussion and the inclusion of a new results table.  I do think these will benefit the paper a lot and probably can be done with one extra page, but I am hesitant to increase my score at the moment since they are not yet done and I already put it above acceptance threshold.

[Authors]: Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of our work. We really appreciate your feedback.

Regarding the comparison to FOCUS, it is essential to note that FOCUS is specifically designed for multilingual Masked Language Models (MLMs) and would require significant adaptation to be applicable to LLMs like ours. We understand your curiosity on this, but our past experiments have shown that methods similar to FOCUS usually perform significantly worse in this context. 

Moreover, FOCUS is not applicable to the Tatar language due to its dependence on XLM-R, which does not support Tatar at all. FOCUS initializes embeddings based on tokenizer overlap, as illustrated in Fig. 1 of their paper, which does not work for unsupported languages. This highlights a significant advantage of our method, which requires no prior model supporting the target language of the conversion.

Additionally, we have already provided an updated Table 5 (https://imgur.com/BV0Mj9T) in our previous submission. The updated PC's guidelines however prevent us from including long pieces of text. Nonetheless, we are confident that the additional space we have will be utilized effectively for further discussion and elaboration on our results, and will contribute to an interesting presentation at COLM.

One major thing that's still currently lacking is a wider experimental exploration, with more tasks and more languages, and I would like to see performance on the model also on some standard NLU benchmarks with a selection of languages from those benchmarks taken as additional case study.

It also remains unclear why parallel data might decrease performance (as written in the response to another reviewer), and if parallel data is still needed for the adaptation of distant target languages (where Dutch-to-Frisian might not be the prime example).

One major thing that's still currently lacking is a wider experimental exploration, with more tasks and more languages, and I would like to see performance on the model also on some standard NLU benchmarks with a selection of languages from those benchmarks taken as additional case study.

It also remains unclear why parallel data might decrease performance (as written in the response to another reviewer), and if parallel data is still needed for the adaptation of distant target languages (where Dutch-to-Frisian might not be the prime example).

I would suggest to add the discussion on massively multilingual models versus monolingual adaptation also to the main paper.

All in all, in light of the new information provided in the response, I am happy to adjust my score."

[Reviewer_opdP]: I thank the authors for their detailed and serious engagement with my review.  

Other re-initialization scheme: in response to pLrB, they mention taht FOCUS only applies to MLMs (multilingual models).  While that was the focus of that paper, I do believe the method would work just the same in the current paper's setting and so could be another good comparison.

A lot of my comments and their replies require a non-trivial amount of writing, e.g. improved results discussion and the inclusion of a new results table.  I do think these will benefit the paper a lot and probably can be done with one extra page, but I am hesitant to increase my score at the moment since they are not yet done and I already put it above acceptance threshold.

[Authors]: Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of our work. We really appreciate your feedback.

Regarding the comparison to FOCUS, it is essential to note that FOCUS is specifically designed for multilingual Masked Language Models (MLMs) and would require significant adaptation to be applicable to LLMs like ours. We understand your curiosity on this, but our past experiments have shown that methods similar to FOCUS usually perform significantly worse in this context. 

Moreover, FOCUS is not applicable to the Tatar language due to its dependence on XLM-R, which does not support Tatar at all. FOCUS initializes embeddings based on tokenizer overlap, as illustrated in Fig. 1 of their paper, which does not work for unsupported languages. This highlights a significant advantage of our method, which requires no prior model supporting the target language of the conversion.

Additionally, we have already provided an updated Table 5 (https://imgur.com/BV0Mj9T) in our previous submission. The updated PC's guidelines however prevent us from including long pieces of text. Nonetheless, we are confident that the additional space we have will be utilized effectively for further discussion and elaboration on our results, and will contribute to an interesting presentation at COLM.

We appreciate your understanding and hope these clarifications will address your concerns."
860,SKVQ: Sliding-window Key and Value Cache Quantization for Large Language Models,Accept,lqHhtpPhVu,,,,"[Authors]: > **Q2**: novelty

First, we want to clarify that the problem we are addressing is different from the issues tackled by existing methods. Our primary focus is on ultra-low-bit quantization of KV-cache. Our method is designed based on the key insight

1. we identified outlier channels in the key cache and innovatively recognized that the locality of the attention module can be combined with mixed-precision quantization.

2. We hypothesize that preserving a small portion of the KV-cache (designed as a sliding window) in high precision can effectively reduce quantization error, and our detailed experimental analysis supports this hypothesis.

While some techniques have been employed in various domains before, integrating them to minimize KV-cache quantization error is not trivial. For example, our experiments compared smoothquant and RPTQ, which utilize smoothing and channel-reordering, respectively, and demonstrated that both perform poorly in ultra-low-bit quantization of KV-cache.

Regarding the three techniques you mentioned, we would like to highlight the differences from previous work:

1. Designs similar to the sliding-window have been extensively explored in approximate linear attention models like Longformer[1], and the structural property of attention, particularly locality, has been well-studied in previous works. These studies inspired us and provided a solid theoretical foundation for our method. However, no prior work has combined quantization with the inherent structured nature of attention. We are the first to integrate these two aspects, **thoroughly exploring the potential of attention locality in KV-cache quantization** and designing an algorithm that seamlessly fuses it with KV-cache quantization.

2. While auto-clip techniques have been applied in works like AWQ[2], they were used for weight quantization. We are the first to apply clipping techniques to KV-cache quantization. There is a significant difference between the two: since weight distributions are known, precomputing clip values offline is straightforward. In contrast, KV-cache is generated dynamically, making online auto-clipping in dynamic quantization impractical due to unacceptable overhead. Our research discovered that **approximating and precomputing clip thresholds on a small calibration set effectively addresses the clipping challenge** for KV-cache and effectively improves accuracy.

3. KVQuant does not employ channel reordering; it performs per-channel non-uniform quantization by clustering within each channel. In contrast, SKVQ conducts **per-token uniform quantization** by extracting value distribution features from each channel, grouping similar channels, and applying uniform quantization to each group. The concept of channel reordering has indeed been used in RPTQ[3], but [3] aims to reduce weight-activation quantization loss through reorder-indexing. We firstly apply channel-reordering to KV-cache quantization.

We will further emphasize our insights and clarify the differences between our approach and previous work in the revised version. Thank you for pointing it out!

[Authors]: > **Q5**: Effectiveness of H2O

Firstly, we'd like to clarify that while H2O serves as a cache eviction policy, it isn't directly applicable to quantization in KV-cache. Achieving the goal of using accumulative attention scores to determine the important token for mixed-precision quantization requires careful design.

There are a lot of details, let's begin from vanilla dynamic per-token RTN quantization during decoding. We face a dilemma: on one hand, we need to generate more tokens to assess the importance of the current token; on the other hand, we need to make an immediate decision whether to quantize this token to a low-precision.

A sliding-window strategy resolves this effectively! Upon generating a token pair `cache_t` at decoding step $t$, we defer quantization until the it slides out of the window (i.e., at decoding step $t+W$). Then, based on the accumulative attention scores of the subsequent $W$ tokens on `token_t`, we decide whether to retain it at high precision. 

Our strategy is implemented as follows: for a token $t_i$ that slides out of the window, we accumulate it's attention score in $step_{i+1},\cdots, step_{i+W}$. If this score exceeds the cumulative score of the previous $96%$(or other threshold) of tokens, we consider this token as a **heavy hitter** and protect it from quantizing to low-precision.

The score in the table is the average score in needle in haystack test, same with Figure5 in our paper. We set the ratio of full precision to **4%**. we use RTN, without channel reorder and clipping.

The results indicate that enabling heavy hitter in filter rules marginally improves accuracy. It can't outperform the random baseline, indicating that our current design approach does not yield significant benefits. At the same time, it comes with 2 limitations:

1. Heavy hitter determination relies on attention scores, which are inaccessible during inference with existing fusion operators like flashattention, flashinfer. This necessitates a custom operator for accessing cumulative scores, leading to significant overhead.
2. The dynamic nature of heavy hitters requires an additional index at runtime, introducing substantial overhead, particularly in ultra-low-bit quantization.

These drawbacks hinder the feasibility of this approach. Thus, while we haven't further adopted this strategy in our experiments, we believe there are more efficient ways to implement heavy hitters detection and more effective filter rules to enhance SKVQ performance.

[Authors]: > **Q6**: RoPE and Quantization?

Because we perform pre-RoPE quantization, we store pre-RoPE KVCache, requiring RoPE to be applied at each decoding step. Experiments in FlashInfer[1] has shown Fused-RoPE Attention kernel can apply RoPE on the fly with negligible overhead.

[1] Ye, Z. FlashInfer: Kernel Library for LLM Serving.

> **Q8**: Is fake quantization employed? Quantization Kernel and Memory Storage Details

Regarding the details of FP8: We simulate the use of FP8 by first computing the quantization parameters (zero-point and scale) in FP16, then converting the values to FP8 using `round-to-nearest-even` rounding, and finally converting them back to FP16.

kernel implementation details: We have currently implemented the quant/dequant CUDA kernel and are continuing to optimize it. Specifically, as mentioned in the answer to Q5, the kernel details for the quantization process are as follows:

1. We adjust the output channels of the weight (`QKV_projection`) to avoid explicit reordering.
2. Using the pre-computed reorder index, we determine the range of each group and calculate the group-shared scale and zero-point in FP16, then convert them to FP8, store in sequence by group.
3. Next, we perform packing: for the 2-bits K/V cache, we pack every four adjacent numbers within the same group into one `uint8` for storage. Although the group size might not align perfectly with 4, leading to some waste, this is negligible (at most $0.8 \times NumGroup$ bytes). 

After quantization and packing, the original KV-cache shape $[bs, SeqLen, NumHeads, HeadDim]\Rightarrow [bs, SeqLen, PackDim]$, where $PackDim \approx NumHeads \times HeadDim / 8$. This reduces the memory footprint of the KV-cache by around 800% compared to FP16.

During the decoding step:

1. Based on the starting position index of the packed groups (obtained from the reorder index during the offline pre-computation), we determine the starting position of each group, find the corresponding scale and zero-point, and dequantize to FP16. Then, we reorder the results back to the original sequence using the inverse reorder index and write them back to HBM.
2. Execute RoPE and the Attention Kernel with FP16 KV-cache.

It worth noting that the dequant, subsequent RoPE, and Decoding Kernel can be fused together, eliminating the need to write the intermediate dequantized KV-cache back to HBM. We are continuously optimizing this fused kernel, and will open source it.

[Reviewer_KwiV]: Thank you for your detailed response. My concerns have been addressed. I also acknowledge the difficulties in incorporating the H2O methodology. Also, I'd like to suggest that maybe you can apply the SnapKV[1] methodology alongside FlashAttention. I would appreciate if the revised version includes experimental results on long context generation thoroughly. 

Happy to increase my score to 7!

About 2 bits and 1.5 bits.
I understand that in this paper, those are just statistical averages.

And with 1.5 bits - only '3' (of course practically one cannot encode half a bit).

It looks like those values are close to acting as yes/no gates on the attention.
This is speculative, but maybe the authors want to consider this.

[Authors]: Your speculation is largely correct. After ternary quantization(1.5 bits quantization), the values within a group are quantized to {-1, 0, 1}, making the dot-product operation (as used in attention computation) entirely a select-and-accumulate operation, just as you described with the ""Yes/No"" gate analogy.

However, we must point out that since SKVQ performs asymmetric uniform quantization with group, after the selection and accumulation through the ""Yes/No"" gate, scaling is required, and the zero-point compensation must be added.

You have provided an excellent perspective, which is very intriguing. If you have any further ideas, we would be delighted to discuss them with you further."

Since we are not sure whether your concern about the ""bottleneck"" at prefill phase refers to **computation** or **memory**, in addition to the above explanation of memory, we will add an additional explanation of computation in prefill phase:

For each layer, we use the full-precision activation generated from the `QKV_projection` for attention computation, which is identical to the full-precision model. Additionally, we quantize the full-precision KV embedding into low-precision KV-cache for storage, which introduce a lightweight overhead. 

Using full-precision KV embeddings for attention at prefill phase is a common practice in many quantization algorithms, such as FlexGen and KIVI. Overall, SKVQ provides **no speedup compared to full-precision model at prefill phase, but also no significant additional overhead.**

> **Q2**:  Evaluation on long generation scenarios 

More explanation about the experiments:

1. The average generated length was approximately **1500 tokens**. 

2. Although there are some significant shortcomings in the above experiment, such as the limited sample size, we believe the results to som extent indicate that SKVQ has a good performance in long generation scenarios. In some cases, the diversity of the generated content due to quantization even results in higher scores compared to the full precision model.

Should you have any further inquiries, please let us know and we are more than delighted to discuss with you and run more experiments for any pieces of your interests in our work.

> **Q3**: Evaluation  on larger models?

We evaluated SKVQ on Llama3-70B-Instruct on LongBench, which adopt GQA with $\text{NumHeads}=64, \text{NumKVHeads=8}$ (i.e. 8 queries share one KV-cache group). Our results show that for most tasks, SKVQ's accuracy loss is within 2%, and for some tasks, it is lossless. However, for a few tasks like `Qasper`, SKVQ experiences more significant accuracy loss. We believe this is largely because the full-precision model itself performs poorly on this task. We believe this experiment further demonstrates the generalization ability of SKVQ on models of larger size.

We sincerely appreciate the time and efforts you have dedicated to reviewing our paper. Should you have any further inquiries, please let us know and we are more than delighted to discuss with you and run more experiments for any pieces of your interests in our work.

[Reviewer_QPwH]: Thank you for the detailed response. My concerns have mostly been addressed.

Regarding Q1, there are some real-world cases where long prompts are used with short generations, e.g. 4K/8K tokens in prefill and generating only 64 tokens. In these scenarios, the prefill can account for up to 20-30% of the end-to-end inference time, and this ratio could be even higher if decoding becomes faster, as suggested in the paper. While I believe that this paper is very useful in general cases, I wanted to note that there are still some corner cases that may require further investigation.

[Authors]: We are pleased that our response has addressed some of your concerns. We fully agree with the scenario you mentioned, especially in contexts like summarizing extremely long texts (e.g., 1 million tokens). In the prefill phase, due to the quadratic complexity, this part of the computation can indeed dominate the inference time. SKVQ may not provide significant acceleration for such scenarios. However, we do believe this limitation extends beyond the capability boundaries of most KV-cache quantization efforts.

Overall, we greatly appreciate your detailed and insightful feedback."

1. Could the authors clarify again about the main contribution of the paper? A few things I hope to understand more a) the fully connected topology seems to be a strong assumption; consider the empirical nature of this study, I am not convinced that extending to other topology and/or partial participation is easy for the reweighting strategies studied in this paper. b) related to a) there are many decentralized algorithms studied before, maybe I missed it, but I am not sure if they are discussed at all. For example [𝐷2: Decentralized Training over Decentralized Data] c) if the main focus is the reweighting strategies, it is also a problem that has been extensively studied in the literature, see section 3.2.4 in [A Field Guide to Federated Optimization] for papers before 2021, and more recent papers like [Revisiting Weighted Aggregation in Federated Learning with Neural Networks]. d) if the main focus in personalization, I am not convinced that a simple baseline of FedAvg + local finetuning is out of scope for comparison. Note that I did not ask for an extensive table like in [pFL-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for
Personalized Federated Learning] which benchmarks 10+ methods, but IMHO, ignoring the entire literature seems a little disappointing. e) if this paper considers their contribution is to study a problem that has been largely overlooked before, please clarify the motivation related to question a) about topology and assumption. And carefully clarify their relationship with the literature. 

2 I can accept the ""trust"" term if the authors can provide a few concrete reference that uses this term in this manner. They can be from the social science literature. Otherwise I would strongly encourage a replacement like ""similarity"" or something.

[Authors]: Thanks for your quick response.

1. Regarding topology and partial participation, we understand that they should naturally be compatible with our current scheme. For instance, consider a specific client i. In rounds where client i is selected, we reweight all other selected clients connected via edges in that round. If no clients have a similar data distribution, our scheme assigns high self-trust and low trust towards others. Conversely, if there are clients with similar data distributions, our scheme assigns higher trust to these clients, allowing client i to make a better update in that round. A more sparse topology and low participation ratio will require more communication rounds to converge. 


 We agree FedAvg + Local FineTuning would be a valid baseline to compare to, but in our experimental setup, we only have a training set (where we train models) and validation set (where we report the test performance, it is more like a test set).  To our understanding, local fine-tuning requires some additional personalized data before evaluation, which we do not have. Therefore, we allocated a certain ratio (% in the parentheses) of the training data for fine-tuning and kept the rest for FedAvg training. The results are shown in the table below. With fine-tuning, the perplexity even went higher for some scenarios. We speculate that this may be due to the reduced amount of data available for FedAvg training and overfitting on personalized data.

Please note that we did not claim to propose new decentralized personalization algorithms. In our opinion, the **main contribution** of this paper lies in two aspects: 1) we explore _realistic_ data heterogeneity among users in decentralized language modeling; and 2) we demonstrate that collaboration can be leveraged to improve personalization performance in language modeling. By personalization, we mean that each client has a personalized state. We hope the FedAvg + FT experiment illustrates that balancing personalization and collaboration is not straightforward in language modeling. Despite the drastic differences between categories, there are notable similarities in sentence structure and word choices, alongside domain-specific word choices, unlike typical classification tasks. Additionally, the preferences for collaboration or personalization vary across different datasets. For example, in the case of AG News, local training yields better results than FedAvg, whereas this is not true for Codes-Wiki. Our strategies can intelligently adapt to these different scenarios.

2. Yes, here are some references: 
- ""Similarity measures could be useful to assess trust between users. For example, in opinion dynamics models, it has been proved that users tend to consider and trusting more other users with similar opinions to them” [1]
- “The trust degree between individuals derived from opinion similarity at time t.[2]
   
If we view clients as members of a social group, their model state or predictions on a shared dataset can thus be regarded as opinions.

3. We adopt the experimental setup as we focus on the same cross-silo scenario in the language domain. Please note that there are not many existing works that studied decentralized learning in language modeling. We think such an experimental setup demonstrates our purposes (see our clarification on contributions in point 1)

4. Yes that’s a good suggestion, we will adopt this term in future iterations.

[Reviewer_pToR]: Thanks for the response. 

1. Could the authors clarify again about the main contribution of the paper? A few things I hope to understand more a) the fully connected topology seems to be a strong assumption; consider the empirical nature of this study, I am not convinced that extending to other topology and/or partial participation is easy for the reweighting strategies studied in this paper. b) related to a) there are many decentralized algorithms studied before, maybe I missed it, but I am not sure if they are discussed at all. For example [𝐷2: Decentralized Training over Decentralized Data] c) if the main focus is the reweighting strategies, it is also a problem that has been extensively studied in the literature, see section 3.2.4 in [A Field Guide to Federated Optimization] for papers before 2021, and more recent papers like [Revisiting Weighted Aggregation in Federated Learning with Neural Networks]. d) if the main focus in personalization, I am not convinced that a simple baseline of FedAvg + local finetuning is out of scope for comparison. Note that I did not ask for an extensive table like in [pFL-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for
Personalized Federated Learning] which benchmarks 10+ methods, but IMHO, ignoring the entire literature seems a little disappointing. e) if this paper considers their contribution is to study a problem that has been largely overlooked before, please clarify the motivation related to question a) about topology and assumption. And carefully clarify their relationship with the literature. 

2 I can accept the ""trust"" term if the authors can provide a few concrete reference that uses this term in this manner. They can be from the social science literature. Otherwise I would strongly encourage a replacement like ""similarity"" or something. 

3 Following settings in existing papers is a great practice. But I also want to highlight that experiments should be designed to support the contributions of the paper. The focus of  [Sun et al.

I acknowledge the contribution on heterogenous data and the motivation of combining collaboration and personalization. I would encourage the authors to improve the writing, and happy to further engage before discussion ends.

[Authors]: Thanks for your response and score adjustment. We will include your helpful comments in future iterations.

We address your concerns as follows:

- We opted for a fully connected topology because we are focusing on a cross-silo scenario with a small number of clients. This is the case for the standard federated learning setup, where the server can easily relay meta-data between all clients (see Table 2.1 in [4]). In the more general decentralized case where a different  connected topology is preferred, one can replace the current trust matrix W with a sparse version, where some entries are zero. Our setting thus includes both federated learning as well as arbitrary decentralized training. As long as the graph represented by W is strongly connected (i.e., every vertex is reachable from every other vertex), our algorithm should still function, though convergence will be slower. 
      
We provide experimental results on the training time (X times the needed training iterations as in the fully connected case) required for a ring topology to achieve the same perplexity level as a fully connected topology in the table below. Note that NA indicates we did not reach the same perplexity after ten times the training iterations. In high heterogeneity scenarios with a very sparse ring topology, each client is allocated a specific category. This can result in cases where adjacent clients in the ring do not share any categories, leading to an oracle trust weight of 0 and hence the NA entries. Despite this, our algorithm can still learn, converging to a perplexity approximately one point higher than what is reported for the fully connected case.

Method | Multi-Wiki Low | Multi-Wiki High | Codes-Wiki Low | Codes-Wiki High |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |  
Local | 1 | 1 | 1| 1 |
FedAvg | 1.6 | 4.2 | 2.0| 1.7 |
S1 | 5.9 | 12.0 |2.0 | 2.1 |
S2 | 1.1 | 2.6 | 1.5 | NA |
S3 | 2.9 | NA |1.2 | 3.8 |

2. We summarize the insights as follows:
- From strategy 1 underperforming the other two strategies, we conclude that predictions are more informative than model weights in identifying collaborators in language modeling.
- Both as predictions-based collaborator selection methods, strategy 3 outperforms strategy 2. We further investigated the evolution of learned trust matrices. We found the trust matrices in strategy 3 are more stable across communication rounds compared to strategy 2, with fewer abrupt changes in values, and the trust matrices from strategy 3 have higher diagonal values than those from strategy 2. We cannot definitively explain why strategy 2 underperforms, but we speculate that the more stable trust matrix and higher self-trust in strategy 3 contribute to stabilizing the learning process, leading to better results.

3. As we mentioned in an earlier response, we are not proposing a SOTA method, instead we aim to understand how to balance personalization and collaboration. Moreover, as we focus on a server-less setup, the standard way is to use gossip averaging algorithm (which does collaborator selection), without getting a global model state involved [1,2,3]. That is also a reason why we did not compare personalization algorithms where a server is assumed.

Thanks a lot and we welcome further discussions if things are unclear.

I do believe that the aim/motivation of the paper could be made clearer with some reformulations in the text, along the lines of what you write in your response. I think that the examples of generated synthetic data - I think this would be a useful contribution to the supplementary material, although it would have been good to have a more detailed analysis of the generated data.

I maintain that it would be more interesting to test different numbers of training examples other than 16 per class, which is very few (even if this is what some other works have done, I am not convinced that it that realistic). In reality, with a bit of annotation it is often possible to have more examples than 16 per class. I would therefore find it realistic to test the method with varying amounts of data to ascertain what the threshold is for prompt tuning still lagging behind FT.

I therefore choose to keep the same score.

[Authors]: I want to clarify that **“with a bit of annotation …”** is impossible for many real-world tasks especially for rare diseases. The assumption of the availabity of sufficient labeled data is unrealistic. Many machine learning fields have been dedicated to solve this problem including transfer learning, zero-shot and few-shot learning (FSL). FSL focuses on enabling models to learn new tasks from a very limited amount of data – typically only a few examples, hence the term ""few-shot"". I won’t repeat the facts and significance about FSL but refer you to the survey [1]. 

* Scale is the power of today’s LLMs! Preceding research established many neural scaling laws for deep learning models [2,3]. It is a known fact that as the amount of training data decreases, the model’s performance degrades significantly. If annotated data is not a problem, maybe one panacea can cure all diseases. Unfortunately, data is a big problem! **Few-shot setting is at the tail of the scaling law** and **abundant research have been done to elevate the performance of this extreme case at the tail**. These methods predominantly leverage external knowledge, such as pretraining and transfer learning, to guide the model in learning effectively from a few examples. 

Based on these findings and limitations, we **focus on pushing the boundary of prompt tuning in few-shot settings with the help of generative AI.** 

* Studying scaling laws involves non-trivial computational costs. This is not the focus of this paper (as we presented many other interesting findings if you read the paper), therefore we referred you to previous studies conducted **exactly for comparing prompt tuning and full-model tuning given different amounts of real data**. Scaling up in our problem setting is **extremely resource-intensive** and deviates from our main objective. *It involves generator tuning, data generation, and prompt tuning for every random seed and every hyperparameter setting*. For example, suppose we fix 5 random seeds and 3 hyperprameter settings, and want to plot 10 points for drawing the scaling law for a single NLI task, it would approximately take about (2h + 3h + 2h) * 5 * 3 * 10 = 1050 hrs = 43 days on the A6000 workstation for both training and evaluation. This study obviously does not worth the costs compared to other more important studies. Please allow this paper to present limited (but nontrivial) findings as we can only push forward the science step by step. 

The opportunity for us to conduct rebuttal and discussion is to solve your questions to avoid biased scores, encourage insightful discussions and for us to receive constructive suggestions to improve the paper. It is not meant for debating on some already established facts and problems, for which we should remain honest and scientific. Since I have addressed most of your questions, I would expect you to justify your score with sound reasons and facts, presented professionally. I really hope you can spend a little more time to reread and understand this paper's contributions, and also want to refer you to other reviewers’ justifications. We’re actively working on improving the paper and hope to receive your constructive suggestions and more importantly, a fairer score!


## A take-away summary of the key contributions

Although it has been clearly stated at the beginning of this paper, we want to clarify in short what our contributions are for your reference.

Prompt tuning, conditioned on LLMs, has demonstrated competitive performance as full-model tuning under full-data settings. However, recent studies uncovered that prompt tuning significantly underpeforms full-model tuning in few-shot settings, limiting its application scope (Problem). Conventional methods generally rely on transfer learning from real-world datasets, which assumes the availability of large-scale, real-world, task-relevant datasets (Limitations of existing solutions). This paper builds on recent research for “LLMs as training data generators” to provide an alternative solution for advancing prompt tuning in few-shot settings (Motivation). We identified the problem of potential ill distributions in synthetic datasets and proposed DawGen to promote distribution alignment for synthetic data generation (Contribution 1). We want to make the best use of few-shot and synthetic data to further enhance downstream learning performance. Hence, we employ gradient surgery to modify the gradients from synthetic data by always projecting them onto the direction of real-data gradients and subtracting conflicting components (Contribution 2).

RE: 1-shot Yelp. Thank you for the additional experiments!
- Following up on this, is 1-shot the most that you can do given context length limits of the LLMs?
- To clarify, my point was broader that just Yelp: It was that, to be fair to the baselines, se should at least do k-shot for the highest k possible given context length limits (1-shot being the minimum).

[Authors]: We again thank the reviewer for their constructive feedback to help us improving the paper.

Regarding the last point: We appreciate your explanation and agree it is a great suggestion. Yes, 1-shot (5+1 examples in the input prompt) is the headroom for Yelp-5 on the LLMs we use. Note that we follow the publicly hosted benchmark which provides up to 10-shot for each dataset. We will try to add ablation studies to go beyond 10-shots and update here or in the next version, which needs nontrivial efforts including gathering and sampling additional training demonstrations and performing inference. We feel the benefit of LAMPO may be more prominent as position bias can be more difficult to mitigate (due to its combinatorial nature) for existing baselines such as GlobalE. We really appreciate the suggestion."

[Reviewer_Nicz]: Thanks for the rebuttal.

For 1. Please correct me if I am wrong. From my perspective, ""comparing losses across different model families"" is basically the same as comparing somewhat 'metrics' on a held-out dataset across different model families. I think this is the common practice in multiple domain. e.g. comparing different image understanding architectures' generalization capability by comparing imagenet accuracy b/w VGGNet, AlexNet, and ResNet. Unfortunately, I don't think I am persuaded that this is considered as a new novelty.

For 3. Just a quick check, IIUC, I think data leakage would also affect the BPC?

[Authors]: Thanks for the response. 

As in the previous rebuttal, we do agree with the reviewer that the concept of ""comparing some metrics on a held-out dataset"" is not new, yet we emphasize that the main point of this paper is not to propose a brand new evaluation approach, but to demonstrate the **linear correlation** between downstream performance and losses across different model families, which has not been revealed before and we don't think it was obvious that such a strong linear correlation exists across different model families. Additionally, while ""comparing losses"" is not something new, comparing losses across different model families requires to take care of several factors properly -- as we mentioned in the rebuttal --  such as accounting for variations in tokenizers via the BPC metric and unifying the context window size. These specific factors were often overlooked in previous research, but we have observed that failing to properly address these factors can completely disrupt the strong correlation with downstream results.

For 3 on the data leakage discussion, you are right that data leakage will also influence BPC. However, here the difference is that the dataset for BPC can be automatically refreshed without significant human efforts -- just as in the paper, we simply run a pipeline script to obtain the corpora to test BPC. We can always refresh the corpora to the latest data easily through executing a program, which will mitigate the leakage issue through using the newest data. This is what we meant as dynamic eval since the eval data can be dynamically changed automatically. In contrast, most downstream task benchmarks are static and rarely updated, because expensive human efforts are required to create new datasets there."

We would like to once again thank you for your valuable feedback, and hope you can get a chance to see our responses to your concerns. 

We also ran an additional experiment on varying perspectives, a type of knowledge conflict beyond word-level edits, using the PrimeValue dataset [1] to further address your concern on the complexity of real-world knowledge conflicts. The dataset includes controversial situations such as “giving money to your son”, “giving blood”, and “electing Barrack Obama”. We elicit parametric viewpoints of GPT-4-turbo and employ GPT-3.5-turbo to create opposite viewpoints following [2], composing an evaluation dataset of 350 positive samples and 350 negative samples. Employing the CoT prompting method results in a precision of 0.98, a recall of 0.78, and an F1 score of 0.87 in Task 1. This aligns with our conclusion that LLMs can perform well above random in identifying the existence of knowledge conflicts, though under this setting, the results are limited to the assumption that the LLM only has one unique firm viewpoint on each situation. Please see details below.

[Reviewer_iYTh]: Thank you for the responses. Locating the conflicts is certainly a step toward resolving them. However, with many similar works before, I think more efforts (or pages) should be put into the resolving methods.

I re-read the paper while referencing to your rebuttal and related works. I feel that I have a better understanding of the contribution of this paper now. While most points are understood, I feel that I still have reserved opinions about the two statement below.

**1.** Re: intact token v. byte-level tokens: whether the former provides more semantics when fed to an LLM. 

The original statement and the explanation are both centred around human interpretation of words/characters.

[Authors]: >  I find the current justification (relying on semantics) unsupported.

We appreciate the reviewer's insights and understanding of the concerns regarding the use of ""morphology"" and ""phonology"" in the context of LLMs where tokens are mapped to indices and vectors. Our justification for stating that byte-level tokens ""do not provide any semantic meaning"" is based on three primary reasons: semantic integrity, prevention of generating non-existent characters, and improved tokenization efficiency and contextualization.


1. Semantic Integrity:
Byte-level tokens can result in shared tokens for characters with vastly different meanings. For instance, ""猟"" (hunt) is encoded as <0xE7> <0x8C> <0x9F>, and ""猫"" (cat) is encoded as <0xE7> <0x8C> <0xAB>, sharing with the identical first two bytes despite their different meanings. This overlap can dilute the semantic integrity of Japanese kanji letters, which are ideograms unlike most of other languages. It is possible to argue that English also suffers from the same problem, e.g., “cat” and “car” are totally different, but the treatment of English tokenization is much better than that of Japanese because the tokenizer of the base model was trained on a corpus with a lot of English text and little Japanese text. In other words, it is unlikely for the base tokenizer to split them into “cat” and “car” into <c> <a> <t> and <c> <a> <r>. While LLMs derive semantics from context, starting with more semantic Japanese tokens is reasonable because Japanese kanji letter are ideograms.


2. Prevention of Generating Non-existent Characters:
Byte-level tokenization can produce byte sequences that do not correspond to any valid characters in the target language. For instance, [it is known](https://okumuralab.org/~okumura/misc/230611.html) in Japan that ChatGPT generated the non-existent Japanese word ""視覴,"" allegedly caused by the impossible combination of byte tokens from ""覚(perception)"" and ""聴(listen)."" Such occurrences are less likely if we treat a Japanese kanji as a single token, which respects the boundaries of valid characters and words. This reduces the possibility of generating meaningless or incorrect text and thereby improves the reliability and quality of the model's output.


3. Improved Tokenization Efficiency and Contextualization:
Representing a kanji letter as a single token provides a more consistent and semantically relevant input to the token embeddings, enhancing the model's ability to understand and generate coherent text. For example, ""猫""(cat) = <0xE7> <0x8C> <0xAB> shares the first two tokens with 17 other kanji in byte-level tokenization, which potentially increases the semantic ambiguity and degrades its performance. By adding kanji letters to the vocabulary, we can ensure that each token has a clear and distinct meaning, which improves the model's ability to contextualize and generate accurate representations.


>  I feel that the statement ""impact of vocabulary expansion on performance is minor"" is not accurate.

Thank you for your feedback. we would like to clarify our position regarding the statement, ""the impact of vocabulary expansion on performance is minor.""

Excluding the XL-Sum task, the only dataset where we observed a relative change of more than 10% is JCQA for the Llama-2-JA-7b model. This kind of change was not observed in other model sizes or tasks, as we noted in §5.1.2.

To provide more evidence, we present an additional analysis of the JCQA scores, isolated from the averaged numbers reported in Figure 7. The scores for 7b models’ JCQA with and without vocabulary expansion (VE and $\neg$VE, respectively) are as follows:
|Num. of training tokens (B)|JCQA(VE)|JCQA($\neg$VE)|
|---|---|---|
|0|38.52|38.52|
|20|39.23|45.76|
|40|45.76|39.14|
|60|42.18|49.15|
|80|49.15|52.28|
|100|48.08|54.33|
With 40B tokens used for training, the model with vocabulary expansion (VE) outperforms the one without it ($\neg$VE). This indicates that the JCQA scores are not stable. In contrast, Figure 6 shows that the XL-Sum scores consistently show better performance for the model without vocabulary expansion, exhibiting a different trend.

Furthermore, the average and standard deviation of JCQA scores after training 40B tokens (40,60,80,100 B Tokens) are:

- Vocabulary Expansion (VE): 46.29 ± 3.09
- No Vocabulary Expansion ($\neg$VE): 48.73 ± 6.74

The observed 6.25-point (11.5%) difference of the JCQA scores between the vocabulary expansion (VE) and non-vocabulary expansion ($\neg$VE) of the Llama-2-JA-7b models does not indicate a substantial impact because of the instability and large standard deviation on the dataset.

Therefore, considering these evaluation results and the observed instability, we regard that the impact of vocabulary expansion on overall performance is minor.

You only test three small-scale LLMs less than 10B. From my opinion, which data format for graphs is better is more likely model-independent and a such conclusion may be misleading. You can also recommended to test larger LLMs or APIs to convince the readers.

> In most of the failure cases, the outputs are some meaningless text like “node1, node2, …”. We hypothesize that this is because LLM didn't understand the graph structure from our prompt. We will try different prompts with more detailed explanations and report any influence in the final version.

From my experience with LLMs for graph problems, this behavior seems unusual. It likes the behavior of LLaMA 2 7b without the chat version. The chat version can follow your insturctions and make a prediction. Please double check it, and also consider providing some examples in prompts.

Overall, I think the paper has some merits and interesting findings that worth an accept. So I raised my score."

771,Automata-based constraints for language model decoding,Accept,FjMUiMxOC9,,,,"[Reviewer_mjW2]: Dear authors,

thanks for your careful response. I was aware of the example provided in the introduction. However, what I was missing in the paper is a specific example of how your technique succeeds in constraining the LLM output where another previously existing one fails. This could be shown for instance for the Willard & Louf, 2023 technique. 

After reading your rebuttal, I was wondering if the scoring distortion problems you mention would apply to the Willard & Louf's technique.

[Authors]: Sorry for our misunderstanding.  Our approach and Outlines have the **same guarantees for regular expressions**, so we cannot provide an example where either system is better than the other.  Our approach is **strictly better for grammars**, because Outlines [prevents tokens from crossing (non)terminal boundaries](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines/issues/684), whereas we do not.

As an example of where this might cause issues for Outlines but not our system, reconsider the example above, but now in the context of a CFG like:

```
S => FUNCTION ""("" NUMBER "")""
FUNCTION => ""foo"" | ""bar""
NUMBER => ""123"" | ""456""
```

Since `foo`, `(`, `123`, and `)` are separate terminals, LM scoring with Outlines **would be distorted** in the manner described above, where the first and last rows are excluded and the LM scoring after constraints inverts the ranking of `foo(123)` vs `bar(456)`.  In contrast, our approach does not have any restrictions on (non)terminal boundaries, so LM scoring is **not distorted**.

Note that the grammar above is not contrived or specially-constructed to cause problems—in programming language grammars it is natural to treat parentheses, identifiers, and numbers as separate terminals.

One last note is that even if we had full parity with Outlines in terms of guarantees or correctness, our system is still more **generic/modular** and **much faster**."
771,Automata-based constraints for language model decoding,Accept,6XWtnhHkVq,,,,"[Reviewer_iNwk]: In this response, the authors do confirm what I already inferred, that their finite state composition approach was more generalizable than other approaches like that of Outlines, which is helpful.  As far as the reasons this is more useful, I do think this is covered well in the paper and I am also aware of the ""wealth of well-optimized algorithms"" available with automata.  Though useful to know, this clarification alone doesn't change my score of the paper.

As far as the weakness regarding experiments, if they author do make the changes promised, this would add substantially to the paper, at least shifting it to ""6: Marginally above acceptance threshold"" if not higher.  However, I am not able to review such changes myself, I can only score the paper as written, so I will raise my score to ""5"".

[Reviewer_mjW2]: I deeply appreciate the careful responses of the authors. I think they have made a nice work with the paper as I stated in my initial review. However, when analyzing the messages exchanged in the rebuttal period, I continue thinking that the paper in its current state does not include important empirical results demonstrating the improvements introduced by their technique, and in my view, their inclusion would require to conduct a new review process. Because of this, I cannot modify the score I have assigned to the paper. In any case, I strongly encourage the authors to introduce the new data into the paper, since this will result in a really nice work."

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer,

Thank you for providing comments on our paper. Hopefully, our rebuttal addresses your concerns, and we are happy to answer any further questions you may have.

In summary:

- Our taxonomy is inspired by, yet substantially different from, prior studies. For example, ""invented"" or ""subjective"" are often grouped as ""unverifiable."" Our careful human annotations on 1k LM responses in multiple domains show that most hallucinations can be classified into one of these categories.
- Regarding the baselines, we indeed compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods discussed in related work, such as FActScore, which first extracts a set of atomic statements and validate each of them using retrieved passages, and is widely used for hallucination detaction. Please note that the suggested paper [1] was arXived on January 6, 2024, which is considered concurrent work according to the NLP/ML conferences' reviewing protocol (e.g., ACL review policies [2]), and comparison of such work is not required.
- We will include more details of our training in the final version of the paper.

This relieves authors from the obligation to make detailed comparisons that require additional experimentation and/or in-depth analysis

[Reviewer_eZfJ]: It is fine to not include a comparison with the related woik [1] according to ACL policy.
How about comparing with other methods that check for factuality? This is very similar to your verification using retrieved documents.
The new categories are slightly different from the existing ones. The newly introduced categories have the problems mentioned in the review. In the rebuttal, the authors said that ""subjective"" depend on factuality. Then what difference can be made between ""subjective"" and ""unverifiable""? The justification of the new categories seems weak and they are not well defined.
Despite the explanation in the rebuttal, the main problems mentioned in the review are still there and not solved."

[Reviewer_Lc32]: Thank you for your reply but I think you missed one of my questions.

In Reasons To Reject:

""Regarding 2, could you provide the agreement scores among human annotators specifically for 'invented' and 'unverifiable' errors? It appears that the currently submitted agreement scores do not specify this for each specific type.""

Would you be able to provide the scores?

[Authors]: We apologize for overlooking that question in our response. We have calculated the cohen-kappa agreement scores for both types, getting 0.356 for 'unverifiable' and 0.636 for 'invented' across all our annotations. We will include a detailed breakdown of the agreement scores for each hallucination type in our camera-ready version.

[Reviewer_Lc32]: The Cohen-Kappa agreement scores for ""unverifiable"" are quite low, which could negatively affect the reasonability of the taxonomy. Have you analyzed the reasons for these low scores?"

- **We performed additional inference time and memory usage experiments**. Our results show that: **our inference cost is even lower than that of a single encoder with the same parameter size, demonstrating the efficiency of the m-patch-one-token method and parallel encoding with multi-visual-experts.**

- We elaborated that our performance gains are **comparable to (or even higher than)** other recently published works.

- Our experiments confirmed that vision tokens don’t degrade baseline performance even without second PE. We effectively mitigated this issue by proposing multi-patch-single-token projection and Share-all PE.

- **We answered all your questions and addressed your concerns**, and we promise to add the necessary results and descriptions to enhance readability.

> **W1: All the experiments are conducted via the post-processing, GPT-4 evaluation and probability evaluation can be adopted.**

Thanks for your suggestion. We understand that the GPT-4 evaluation can overlook some format problems and could be more robust than the post-processing script. However, in this paper, we want to thoroughly explore the precise contributions (label space, format, or the discrimination) of demonstrations towards improving end-task performance. Therefore, we have to rely on post-processing to categorize the instances according to the label space and format. Moreover, evaluations based on LLMs are not guaranteed to be accurate, and hence could not provide a reliable conclusion.

> **W2: The definition of OOS, ISOOF and ISIF is not clear.**

Thanks for your suggestion, we will take Reviewer tah4’s suggestions and use the simpler but more clear definition: Label Space := all acceptable labels regardless of
synonyms. Label Format := exact string match.

> **W3: Conclusions and takeaways can be inferred from previous works.**

Thank you for your insightful comment. We respectfully disagree with the claim that our conclusions/takeaways could be inferred from previous works. We take a deep look into the factors contributing to ICL, attempting to provide a definitive answer regarding how ICL benefits model prediction. Our finding can address some unanswered findings including the phenomenon that demonstrations with incorrect labels still enable the model to perform well.
Specifically,

(1) Previous studies have relied on the assumption that ""incorrect labels can still serve as valid demonstrations,"" yet the underlying reasons for the effectiveness of ICL remain unexplored. These studies lack a quantitative analysis of the specific factors in incorrect labels that benefit ICL, and their experiments using randomized labels within demonstrations do not provide sufficient insights.

(2) The usage of term ""Format"" differs. As we stated in Appendix E, previous works' analytical scope on “format” can be interpreted as how format of demonstrations (query-answer pairing pattern) affect performance. In contrast, we specifically decompose the factors into format, space and discrimination, and identify the regulation effect brought by ICL.
We find that a significant portion of ICL's contributions stem from the label space and the format's regulatory effect on model responses, which is absent in previous works.

(3) Pan et. al. 2023 employ the terms of ""Task Recognition"" (TR) and ""Task Learning"" (TL) as two factors contributing to ICL performance. TR denotes the model can maintain good performance even with incorrect input-label mappings, this resembles previous work Min et al.
(2022). TL can indeed be conceptualized as label space regulation in our paper. Their experiments on TL are are limited to altering the label space (such as converting ""positive""/""negative"" labels to 0/1 or other symbols). 
However, since the models they adopted are not instruction-tuned, they wouldn’t be able to explore the regulation effect on response format. This is one major difference between our work and these previous works, as the response generated by current general-purpose, human-instruction-aligned LLMs differ from the early models.

It is obvious that the reverse-cheat settings significantly degrade performance, impacting both discrimination power and the regulation of label space and format (new ISIF). For the decrease in ISIF, as most of our tasks are binary classification tasks, failing to be exposed with ground truth label will make the model blind in deciding the label token to output, supposing the model could still discriminate the class correctly. 
The decrease of new ISIF is especially prominent for ChatGPT, while the other three models are having similar level of decrease. In the meantime, we find that the discrimination power is also compromised, and the decrease in discrimination scores are more severe in the two open-sourced models. Aligning with the analysis in Section 6.2, Mistral and Llama2 appear more susceptible to following labels in demonstrations when the queries are semantically similar.


> **Q4 Writing suggestions**

Thank you for the writing suggestions. We will improve the introduction section and revise the summary of takeaways based on your suggestions for the camera-ready version.

Thanks for your appreciation again!

[Reviewer_aa3n]: I thank the authors for the detailed rebuttal! I think a lot of concerns that I had seem to be addressed (e.g. definition of OOS , ISOOF) and hope they are incorporated into the next version of the draft. Regarding the concern of novelty, it seems like the authors do agree with some similarities to Pan et al 2023 but point out two main differences — more fine-grained treatment of what we mean by ‘format’ and using instruction-tuned models, both of which seem fair. Given this, I would be inclined to increase the score."

> **w3: It’s better to include a deeper examination of the label distribution in ICL.**

Thank you for the suggestion. We would like to first emphasize that the main target and contribution of this work is to decompose the contribution of ICL into label space, label format and discrimination, and study each factor by designing comprehensive experiments. Whereas ""label distribution"" is not under our main scope, we tried our best to interpret the meaning behind ""label distribution"" pointed out by the reviewer and connected it with our study. We came up with the following interpretations.


(1) If ""label distribution"" refers to the distribution of different Ground Truth label (e.g., 30\% positive, 70\% negative), without including any false label, we feel that the analysis in Section 6 regarding the usage of ""cheat"" demonstrations could serve a part of impact of label distribution, as ""cheat"" settings destroy diversity of demonstration labels. The ""cheat"" experiments reveals that diversity of labels plays critical role in selecting demonstrations, evidenced by the observation that ISIF percentage decreases for both ""cheat"" settings.


(2) If ""label distribution"" refers to the rate of randomly assigned non-ground-truth labels (e.g., 70\% Ground-Truth, 30\% False Label), we think this problem is beyond our research scope, since the topic has been well studied, e.g. Yoo et. al. 2022 have conducted detailed analysis on different levels of false labels and measured the sensitivity of label correctness in demonstrations. 
In section 5.3, we conduct another set of experiments by replacing all the ground-truth labels within demonstrations to incorrect labels. 

By decomposing the label space and format, we find that when provided with incorrect labels within the demonstrations, the ICL’s power of regulating label space and format is barely influenced. This observation can explain the reason that incorrect labels within demonstrations have minimal impact on overall performance.

Thank you for your insightful feedback again!"

The ""cheat"" experiments reveals that diversity of labels plays critical role in selecting demonstrations, evidenced by the observation that ISIF percentage decreases for both ""cheat"" settings.


(2) If ""label distribution"" refers to the rate of randomly assigned non-ground-truth labels (e.g., 70\% Ground-Truth, 30\% False Label), we think this problem is beyond our research scope, since the topic has been well studied, e.g. Yoo et. al. 2022 have conducted detailed analysis on different levels of false labels and measured the sensitivity of label correctness in demonstrations. 
In section 5.3, we conduct another set of experiments by replacing all the ground-truth labels within demonstrations to incorrect labels. 

By decomposing the label space and format, we find that when provided with incorrect labels within the demonstrations, the ICL’s power of regulating label space and format is barely influenced. This observation can explain the reason that incorrect labels within demonstrations have minimal impact on overall performance.

Thank you for your insightful feedback again!

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer xiZm,

Thank you for your valuable feedback on our work. We have thoroughly discussed your concerns regarding Z-ICL (by Lyu et al.) and the ""copy effect.""

As the discussion deadline approaches, **we are keen to know if our rebuttal has addressed your concerns and we welcome any further comments and suggestions.**

Thank you again for your insightful contributions.

Best regards,

[Authors]: ### Response to Reviewer aa3n (2/3)

> **W1: All the experiments are conducted via the post-processing, GPT-4 evaluation and probability evaluation can be adopted.**

Thanks for your suggestion. We understand that the GPT-4 evaluation can overlook some format problems and could be more robust than the post-processing script. However, in this paper, we want to thoroughly explore the precise contributions (label space, format, or the discrimination) of demonstrations towards improving end-task performance. Therefore, we have to rely on post-processing to categorize the instances according to the label space and format. Moreover, evaluations based on LLMs are not guaranteed to be accurate, and hence could not provide a reliable conclusion.

> **W2: The definition of OOS, ISOOF and ISIF is not clear.**

Thanks for your suggestion, we will take Reviewer tah4’s suggestions and use the simpler but more clear definition: Label Space := all acceptable labels regardless of
synonyms. Label Format := exact string match.

> **W3: Conclusions and takeaways can be inferred from previous works.**

Thank you for your insightful comment. We respectfully disagree with the claim that our conclusions/takeaways could be inferred from previous works. We take a deep look into the factors contributing to ICL, attempting to provide a definitive answer regarding how ICL benefits model prediction. Our finding can address some unanswered findings including the phenomenon that demonstrations with incorrect labels still enable the model to perform well.
Specifically,

(1) Previous studies have relied on the assumption that ""incorrect labels can still serve as valid demonstrations,"" yet the underlying reasons for the effectiveness of ICL remain unexplored. These studies lack a quantitative analysis of the specific factors in incorrect labels that benefit ICL, and their experiments using randomized labels within demonstrations do not provide sufficient insights.

(2) The usage of term ""Format"" differs. As we stated in Appendix E, previous works' analytical scope on “format” can be interpreted as how format of demonstrations (query-answer pairing pattern) affect performance. In contrast, we specifically decompose the factors into format, space and discrimination, and identify the regulation effect brought by ICL.
We find that a significant portion of ICL's contributions stem from the label space and the format's regulatory effect on model responses, which is absent in previous works.

(3) Pan et. al. 2023 employ the terms of ""Task Recognition"" (TR) and ""Task Learning"" (TL) as two factors contributing to ICL performance. TR denotes the model can maintain good performance even with incorrect input-label mappings, this resembles previous work Min et al.
(2022). TL can indeed be conceptualized as label space regulation in our paper. Their experiments on TL are are limited to altering the label space (such as converting ""positive""/""negative"" labels to 0/1 or other symbols). 
However, since the models they adopted are not instruction-tuned, they wouldn’t be able to explore the regulation effect on response format. This is one major difference between our work and these previous works, as the response generated by current general-purpose, human-instruction-aligned LLMs differ from the early models.

> **Q2: Show std error/ confidence intervals for results**

Thank you for the advice. We will amend the tables with std error in the final version.


> **Q3: An interesting experiment to add here would be retrieve most similar examples from a different label**


Thank you for the suggestion of such a valuable ablation experiment. Follow your suggestion, we conduct experiment with demonstrations retrieved/randomly sampled from the collection of $\neg\ y^\prime$, in comparison with Section 6.2, and call them ""reverse-cheat-rand"" and ""reverse-cheat-retrieval"". The results are listed below (For length limit, we only put the scores averaged across datasets here).

It is obvious that the reverse-cheat settings significantly degrade performance, impacting both discrimination power and the regulation of label space and format (new ISIF). For the decrease in ISIF, as most of our tasks are binary classification tasks, failing to be exposed with ground truth label will make the model blind in deciding the label token to output, supposing the model could still discriminate the class correctly. 
The decrease of new ISIF is especially prominent for ChatGPT, while the other three models are having similar level of decrease. In the meantime, we find that the discrimination power is also compromised, and the decrease in discrimination scores are more severe in the two open-sourced models. Aligning with the analysis in Section 6.2, Mistral and Llama2 appear more susceptible to following labels in demonstrations when the queries are semantically similar.


> **Q4 Writing suggestions**

Thank you for the writing suggestions. We will improve the introduction section and revise the summary of takeaways based on your suggestions for the camera-ready version.

Thanks for your appreciation again!

[Reviewer_aa3n]: I thank the authors for the detailed rebuttal! I think a lot of concerns that I had seem to be addressed (e.g. definition of OOS , ISOOF) and hope they are incorporated into the next version of the draft. Regarding the concern of novelty, it seems like the authors do agree with some similarities to Pan et al 2023 but point out two main differences — more fine-grained treatment of what we mean by ‘format’ and using instruction-tuned models, both of which seem fair. Given this, I would be inclined to increase the score."

Thank you once again for your consideration.

[Reviewer_KkQG]: I've improved my score to 6 based on the new results.

The connection to beam search sounds tenuous. I am a bit more confused about the approach based on this description, since it sounds more like beam=1, but that is not guaranteed to find argmin and it is only an approximation (in general, finding argmin is a challenging search problem). This is also different from my understanding of the method as described in the paper which samples multiple trajectories rather than incrementally does beam search.

[Authors]: Thank you for your continued support of our paper. We appreciate the opportunity to address your recent confusion regarding our methods' connection with beam search. Allow us to provide clarification.

We do not do the beam=1 search, instead, we explore the node as much as we can (although we have set the width=3 in our experiment, that means at each step, the model can either generate:

[rewritten query1, rewritten query2, rewritten query3] or  
[rewritten query1, rewritten query2, decomposed query1] or  
[rewritten query1, decomposed query1, decomposed query2] or  
... 
and so on.

For instance, if the maximum depth is set to 2 and maximum width is set to 3, then the total trajectories will be 9 (3^2); note that for token-level generation, we adopt greedy decoding. After we gather multiple trajectories leading to the potential answers, we use the strategies we describe in the paper (ppl, confidence, ensemble) to extract the final answer as our predicted answer.

I hope the above explanation adequately addresses your question."

[Reviewer_vKjo]: Thank you for the response authors!

1. I was making a writing suggestion that in the introduction, language such as ""However, the pretraining datasets of language models and their processing pipelines are rarely shared with the community…In this paper, we address the aforementioned gap” is clarified as this might lead a reader to believe that this work is helping shed light on training datasets which are not released. The way I understand the contribution of this work is that though people may even release their training data, it is difficult to standardize and compare these different pretraining datasets, and the proposed framework facilitates that. 

2. MINOR CLARIFICATION: On reading the responses to reviewers, I think the contribution of this project will largely depend on including high-quality data sources, and updating the store with new data sources that the community finds important. Would it be possible for the authors to share this plans about this going forward?

[Authors]: Thank you for your comment,

1. We will rephrase this in so that it is completely clear that we do not intend to shed light on training datasets which are not released, as we do not posses this information.

2. We plan to mantain and update the update the framework regularly. Regarding new data sources, since the submission of the current paper we have been working with our community in order to find and add new sources to the framework, in the future we expect to release new versions with new high quality sources with a specific emphasis in underrepresented and under resourced languages. We also expect to release further improvements on the filtering and cleaning scripts for the existing sources in order to produce even higher quality end-datasets.

[Reviewer_vKjo]: Thank you authors for your response!

1. No need to add a disclaimer about this, I was only suggesting to improve the writing and make it more precise so that the main contributions of the paper are clear.

Negative sampling is a long-standing research topic, and in addition to the works we cite in our paper, there are many related studies such as negative sampling [1-5], adversarial sampling [6-9], and additional data-enhanced sampling in information retrieval [10-14]. One of the main designs of our framework is adopting negative sampling to normalize the confidence score for tree-based search across different tools and agents.  Our experiments also demonstrate its effectiveness.

[Reviewer_MW2q]: Thanks for the rebuttal. I do not find the explanation for negative sampling convincing, and the presentation of the paper should be largely improved to make it easier to understand the technical details and results. Therefore, I kept my original rating.

[Authors]: Thank you for your response. Could you please specify the reason you are not convinced? Negative sampling is a long-standing research topic, and in addition to the works we cite in our paper, there are many related studies such as negative sampling [1-5], adversarial sampling [6-9], and additional data-enhanced sampling in information retrieval [10-14]. One of the main designs of our framework is adopting negative sampling to normalize the confidence score for tree-based search across different tools and agents.  Our experiments also demonstrate its effectiveness.

Regarding the presentation, we have carefully addressed your concerns. Could you please specify any remaining points of confusion? Your suggestions are invaluable for us to further improve our work.

676,Why do small language models underperform? Studying Language Model Saturation via the Softmax Bottleneck,Accept,D0saMwIgWL,,,,"[Reviewer_vM6v]: I'm glad to hear that the writing of the paper has been improved. 

Also, thank you for the clarification about the training data and model sizes. However, I still don't think you can justify the framing of this as a constant on the basis of this handful of datapoints. Couching it as an _estimation of the range_ is an improvement over the strong claim in the paper (in the abstract no less). But even then, any such threshold is likely to be a function of other factors rather than a constant, and there isn't enough data in the paper to accurately determine what that function is, nor is it central to the main message of the paper. So I think this claim really ought to be softened and pointed to as a question for future work.

[Authors]: We warmly thank the reviewer for engaging in the discussion process. We agree that this claim is strong as is, especially in the abstract. We can rephrase the sentence in the abstract as:

""We measure the effect of the softmax bottleneck in various settings and *estimate* that models based on less than *roughly* 1000 hidden dimensions tend to adopt degenerate latent representations in late pretraining, which leads to reduced evaluation performance.""

We shall also modify the conclusion accordingly:

""Our results show that performance *noticeably* drops when using a hidden dimension smaller than *roughly* 1000.""

Our goal is not to convey the idea that there is an exact threshold, but rather to show that there is a range of hidden dimension values for which the softmax bottleneck can be a noticeable limitation for language models, and that our empirical evidence suggests that this range of values extends up to *roughly* 1000 *in our experiments*. 

Finally, this claim is only made in the context of the paper, i.e. for causal language models trained with usual English large natural language datasets. Hence, the factors that could come into play are reasonably controlled : the training data is in large quantity and diversity, and the vocabularies extend from 30,000 to 150,000 tokens. We argue that our range estimate should approximately hold in these controlled setups."

* For table 6, what happens with more tokens (it looks like you only compared at 100B token size for Mamba).  Do the results hold at larger token sizes (e.g., 300B)?
* For table 7, please add context length to the paper.  Context length does matter, as linear models will do well with short context, but potentially not long context, and could be one of the advantages of approaches like these.

[Authors]: Q1. About Mamba result.

A1. According to our experimental results, on Wikitext-103, mamba outperforms Hgrn2; as the model size increases (to 3b scale), Hgrn2 outperforms mamba. We will add the results of mamba in future versions.

Q2. More about table 6.

A2. For the fairest comparison, we re trained llama and hgrn2 on the same dataset for 300b tokens, as shown in the follow table. Due to time constraints, we did not train mamba. However, based on the existing results, Hgrn2 outperformed Llama. Training of mamba will be conducted in future.

Q3. Add context length to table 7.

A3. In the upcoming versions, we will add the sequence length in the table. For now, we provide the sequence length for each task.

Q4. The reason for diminishing returns for the 256 expand ratio

A4. This may be related to the sequence length; our current sequence length is 512, and at this sequence length, 128 is likely sufficient for Wikitext-103.

- Besides the technical component of state expansion itself, I agree that the study has novel aspects and I'd encourage the authors to emphasize them in the final version. 

- To support the claim regarding effectiveness and applicability in RNNs more broadly, I'd suggest providing empirical evidence different architectures such as LSTM, GRU, standard RNN. 

- Regarding the downstream performance, my concern has been addressed. It's encouraging that the improvement holds as the model size increases."
649,HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion,Accept,3uLlEdPK0x,,,,"[Reviewer_m3yg]: I'm not Reviewer 9TbB, but just wanted to ask a quick question about the long-context evals here. A lot of the benchmarks in scrolls are long context. When you performed the evaluations, did you truncate to the context length of the trained model like what they did in the [LongLLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16039) paper? Or did you just feed in the entire context without truncation?

[Authors]: Thanks for your comments.  We feed in the entire context without truncation using the lm-eval-harness framework.

[Reviewer_m3yg]: Hmm, in that case, then I find these SCROLLS results a bit strange. I believe the performance of Llama models would usually crash towards 0 if they are evaluated beyond the context length they were trained for (due to the positional encoding). Just to double-check: do you explicitly set the context length to be something very large like 100k? Otherwise, I believe lm-eval-harness might be doing truncation automatically to 2048 (or to the length that the model was trained for) (see [the max_length property here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/lm_eval/models/huggingface.py#L389-L400))

(I also need to double-check again. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)

[Authors]: As a supplement, we also tested the truncated version, and the results are as follows. It can be seen that the overall results are quite similar.

[Reviewer_m3yg]: Makes sense, yeah, I believe this one is pretty consistent with what I would expect for a truncated version. Were you able to double check that the initial version was indeed using the full context?

Thanks for providing these numbers!

649,HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion,Accept,lOrfBg4QUU,,,,"[Reviewer_m3yg]: Thanks for your responses. I think at the core of my concerns is really just trying to make sure that the method is something that's indeed competitive with other models out there. 

Some of my concerns have been addressed, but I still don't feel entirely convinced. 
- Figure 4 is good, but not enough. I think loss is a good indicator *if* paired with other downstream evals (which you indeed do, but see point below)
- I understand your point about other models being trained with 300B tokens and your model only being trained with 100B tokens, but this to me isn't very convincing. Just because your 100B-token model is worse but close to other 300B-token models, it does not necessarily imply that your model will be better when trained at 300B. For example, based on Table 7, HGRN2-3B performs quite poorly at some benchmarks such as Winogrande and ARC-C, as compared to other 3B models. I understand this is probably because it's trained on 100B tokens, but there's no guarantee that going to 300B will fully close those gaps.
- There's also the issue of datasets. If the models that you are comparing against were trained on datasets that are worse than the Pile, then it's not really a fair comparison -- your model will naturally perform better simply because of the dataset. For instance, I found a version of [RWKV4 which was trained on the Pile](https://huggingface.co/BlinkDL/rwkv-4-pile-3b) which gets 59.63 on HellaSwag, which is higher than the results that you reported in the paper for RWKV. I think as much as possible you should be comparing with models that have been trained on the same dataset. 

Other concerns:
- A5: ""Our model only used 100 billion tokens, while the original Mamba 3B used 300 billion tokens, making the comparison unfair."" --> But in the paper you seem to compare with other 3B-300B token models though (e.g. OPT, Pythia, Bloom), so how is Mamba any different?

[Authors]: Thanks for your comments. We will address your concerns as follows:

1. To fairly compare with other methods, we agree that we need to make sure we are using the same dataset with the same consumed tokens. Therefore, we report the results of retraining HGRN2, Mamba, and Llama on the same dataset with the same hyperparameters. The results are shown below:

| Method | PPL |
| --- | --- |
| Llama-3b | 7.129 |
| HGRN2-3b | 6.989 |
| Mamba-3b | 7.056 |

HGRN2 achieves lower ppl than Llama and Mamba in the controlled experiment. (In fact, Mamba is not a peer-reviewed method. Therefore, we do not need to compare with it.)

2. For downstream evals, we trained Llama and HGRN2 on the same dataset with 300B tokens sampled from the SlimPajama and Pile datasets. It can be seen that HGRN2 performs consistently better.

[Reviewer_m3yg]: Thanks for these results. This looks great! I think your Table 2 above should 100% be on the paper. I believe these results are more convincing than both Tables 5 and 6 in the original paper, mostly because these new results present the fairest comparison in terms of compute FLOPs and dataset quality. These numbers give me more confidence me that the method works.

[Authors]: Thank you for your engaging and helpful suggestions! We will ensure that Table 2 is included in the next version of the paper. We are pleased to hear that our discussion has increased your confidence in our work. Could you kindly consider revising your score upwards in response?

[Reviewer_m3yg]: Thanks for your responses. I think at the core of my concerns is really just trying to make sure that the method is something that's indeed competitive with other models out there. 

Some of my concerns have been addressed, but I still don't feel entirely convinced. 
- Figure 4 is good, but not enough. I think loss is a good indicator *if* paired with other downstream evals (which you indeed do, but see point below)
- I understand your point about other models being trained with 300B tokens and your model only being trained with 100B tokens, but this to me isn't very convincing. Just because your 100B-token model is worse but close to other 300B-token models, it does not necessarily imply that your model will be better when trained at 300B. For example, based on Table 7, HGRN2-3B performs quite poorly at some benchmarks such as Winogrande and ARC-C, as compared to other 3B models. I understand this is probably because it's trained on 100B tokens, but there's no guarantee that going to 300B will fully close those gaps.
- There's also the issue of datasets. If the models that you are comparing against were trained on datasets that are worse than the Pile, then it's not really a fair comparison -- your model will naturally perform better simply because of the dataset. For instance, I found a version of [RWKV4 which was trained on the Pile](https://huggingface.co/BlinkDL/rwkv-4-pile-3b) which gets 59.63 on HellaSwag, which is higher than the results that you reported in the paper for RWKV. I think as much as possible you should be comparing with models that have been trained on the same dataset. 

Other concerns:
- A5: ""Our model only used 100 billion tokens, while the original Mamba 3B used 300 billion tokens, making the comparison unfair."" --> But in the paper you seem to compare with other 3B-300B token models though (e.g. OPT, Pythia, Bloom), so how is Mamba any different?

[Authors]: Thanks for your comments. We will address your concerns as follows:

1. To fairly compare with other methods, we agree that we need to make sure we are using the same dataset with the same consumed tokens. Therefore, we report the results of retraining HGRN2, Mamba, and Llama on the same dataset with the same hyperparameters. The results are shown below:

| Method | PPL |
| --- | --- |
| Llama-3b | 7.129 |
| HGRN2-3b | 6.989 |
| Mamba-3b | 7.056 |

HGRN2 achieves lower ppl than Llama and Mamba in the controlled experiment. (In fact, Mamba is not a peer-reviewed method. Therefore, we do not need to compare with it.)

2. For downstream evals, we trained Llama and HGRN2 on the same dataset with 300B tokens sampled from the SlimPajama and Pile datasets. It can be seen that HGRN2 performs consistently better.

[Reviewer_cvJL]: Thanks for the response and the additional efforts. 

- Besides the technical component of state expansion itself, I agree that the study has novel aspects and I'd encourage the authors to emphasize them in the final version. 

- To support the claim regarding effectiveness and applicability in RNNs more broadly, I'd suggest providing empirical evidence different architectures such as LSTM, GRU, standard RNN. 

- Regarding the downstream performance, my concern has been addressed. It's encouraging that the improvement holds as the model size increases."

[Reviewer_HShg]: * For Mamba, it appears to be better than HGRN2 on perplexity, is that right?  If you agree, then and put the Mamba result in the paper, that would be helpful.
* For table 6, what happens with more tokens (it looks like you only compared at 100B token size for Mamba).  Do the results hold at larger token sizes (e.g., 300B)?
* For table 7, please add context length to the paper.  Context length does matter, as linear models will do well with short context, but potentially not long context, and could be one of the advantages of approaches like these.
* For 256 expand ratio, why do you think there is diminishing returns?

If you can address these, I would consider raising my score.

[Authors]: Q1. About Mamba result.

A1. According to our experimental results, on Wikitext-103, mamba outperforms Hgrn2; as the model size increases (to 3b scale), Hgrn2 outperforms mamba. We will add the results of mamba in future versions.

Q2. More about table 6.

A2. For the fairest comparison, we re trained llama and hgrn2 on the same dataset for 300b tokens, as shown in the follow table. Due to time constraints, we did not train mamba. However, based on the existing results, Hgrn2 outperformed Llama. Training of mamba will be conducted in future.

Q3. Add context length to table 7.

A3. In the upcoming versions, we will add the sequence length in the table. For now, we provide the sequence length for each task.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Seqlen | 2k | 4k | 4k | 1k | 1k | 16k |

Q4. The reason for diminishing returns for the 256 expand ratio

A4. This may be related to the sequence length; our current sequence length is 512, and at this sequence length, 128 is likely sufficient for Wikitext-103.

[Reviewer_m3yg]: I'm not Reviewer 9TbB, but just wanted to ask a quick question about the long-context evals here. A lot of the benchmarks in scrolls are long context. When you performed the evaluations, did you truncate to the context length of the trained model like what they did in the [LongLLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16039) paper? Or did you just feed in the entire context without truncation?

[Authors]: Thanks for your comments.  We feed in the entire context without truncation using the lm-eval-harness framework.

[Reviewer_m3yg]: Hmm, in that case, then I find these SCROLLS results a bit strange. I believe the performance of Llama models would usually crash towards 0 if they are evaluated beyond the context length they were trained for (due to the positional encoding). Just to double-check: do you explicitly set the context length to be something very large like 100k? Otherwise, I believe lm-eval-harness might be doing truncation automatically to 2048 (or to the length that the model was trained for) (see [the max_length property here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/lm_eval/models/huggingface.py#L389-L400))

(I also need to double-check again. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)

[Authors]: As a supplement, we also tested the truncated version, and the results are as follows. It can be seen that the overall results are quite similar.

638,ReAct Meets ActRe: Autonomous Annotation of Agent Trajectories for Contrastive Self-Training,Accept,vT22m70SF3,,,,"[Authors]: We'd like to add further clarification about the limitations of ReAct-only sampling, especially to rectify the potentially overclaiming statement of ""`click[< Prev]` *action in WebShop is never performed by ReAct-only sampling*"" in our rebuttal.

The statement was drawn by observing the set of *successful* trajectories obtained by ReAct-only sampling: The `click[< Prev]` action does not exist in this set. When observing all the trajectories gathered by ReAct-only sampling, we indeed find that the `click[< Prev]` action has been performed. However, in our runs, all the trajectories containing the `click[< Prev]` action do not reach the full reward. Compared with the trajectory set gathered by ActRe, the ReAct-only sampling falls short of environmental understanding in terms of the possibility of `click[< Prev]` leading to success. Therefore, we'd like to update the statement in our rebuttal to ""`click[< Prev]` *action in WebShop does not exist in the successful trajectories gathered by ReAct-only sampling in our runs*"". 

Following the ablation studies in Section 4.1, the $R=1$ trajectories in the training set do not cover the `click[< Prev]` action for ReAct-only sampling. On the contrary, the `click[< Prev]` action often appears in the successful trajectories set with ActRe sampling. This explains the case study shown in our rebuttal.

The motivation for ActRe proposed in our rebuttal still holds: Our framework better grounds the agent by rectifying the policy of the LLM itself with uniform action sampling from the environment when exploring the training scenarios. Such practice shares similar intuition with optimistic exploration for the less-chosen actions, as we complement additional exploration probabilities to them.

[Reviewer_QZXM]: Thank you for your response!

I appreciate the additional experiments, but I would expect more results from the ReAct-only baseline as mentioned in my review. I understand that this is difficult to complete during the short rebuttal period, but I do believe this is an important baseline and comparisons should be made in most of their settings.

The added case study is a good starting point to support the claimed motivation, yet the results are relatively preliminary and more quantitative and qualitative results can be added.

In summary, I like the provided experiments, but I would expect more of them for the paper to be published. I'm also curious about how the authors address my second and third points in the weakness section.

[Authors]: Thank you for providing us with the discussion opportunity! 

We are glad to know that you appreciate the experiments we added. We have been trying our best to run additional experiments to cover all the evaluation settings in the main experiments of WebShop. In the following, we provide the full comparison between ReAct-only self-training and our framework (A$^3$T with ActRe) following Tables 4 (task performance) and 6 (data quality) in our paper. For a fair comparison, we use the ""SFT with initial ReAct-only sampling"" model in our previous rebuttal as the Round=0 for ReAct-only, and ""contrastive self-training with initial ReAct-only sampling"" model in our earlier rebuttal as the Round=1 for ReAct-only. We have proceeded to use the Round=1 trained model to do ReAct-only sampling on the training scenarios, and use the accumulated trajectories to train the Round=2 ReAct-only model with contrastive self-training; The same goes for the Round-3 ReAct-only model.

### Supporting the claimed motivation
___

We start with the augmented Table 6, which compares the quality of the accumulated data between our framework and ReAct-only sampling. As the initial ReAct-only sampling was conducted with fair comparison to the sampling with ActRe in Round 1, we omit Round 0 of ours in the following Table.

| Round | Method     | Reward R (\*100) | Success Rate (%) | %{R$\ge$0.75} | %{R$\ge$0.5} |
|-------|------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|------------------|
| 1     | ReAct-only | 81.6            | 55.3             | 69.2       | 91.3             |
| 1     | Ours       | 85.2            | 61.1             | 75.8       | 94.3             |
|
| 2     | ReAct-only | 83.0            | 58.5             | 71.3       | 92.2             |
| 2     | Ours       | 88.9            | 69.4             | 82.6       | 96.3             |
|
| 3     | ReAct-only | 83.3            | 59.1             | 71.8       | 92.4             |
| 3     | Ours       | 90.6            | 73.9             | 85.0       | 96.8             |

According to the results, our framework collects the trajectories with consistently higher rewards and success rate. These quantitative results support our motivation, as the successful / high-reward trajectories could be collected only when the agent system is grounded in the environment with better awareness, and our ActRe has gathered better trajectories in this sense than the ReAct-only method that relies only on the internal reasoning of LLMs. 

We also define two scenario-wise comparison metrics to show the advantage of ActRe in data collection:

- **Outperformance Rate** computes for the percentage of training scenarios where the best trajectory gathered by ActRe has a higher reward than that by ReAct-only sampling. Let the reward of the the best trajectory in the $i$-th scenario gathered by ActRe be $R_{\mathrm{ActRe}}^{(i)}$ , and that by ReAct-only be $R_{\mathrm{ReAct-only}}^{(i)}$. With the number of training scenarios in total as $N$, we define
 
$$\mathrm{Outperformance~Rate} = \frac{{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{1}} \\{R_{\mathrm{ActRe}}^{(i)} \ge R_{\mathrm{ReAct-only}}^{(i)} \\}}{N}$$

- **Success Coverage** calculates the percentage of training scenarios where ReAct-only sampling collects successful trajectories, and ActRe achieves success as well. Let $S_{\rm ReAct-only}$ be the set of scenarios where ReAct-only sampling succeeds, and $S_{\rm ActRe}$ goes similar for ActRe, we define

$$\mathrm{Success~Coverage} = \frac{|S_{\rm ActRe} \cap S_{\rm ReAct-only}|}{|S_{\rm ReAct-only}|}$$

Computing the two metrics for the accumulated trajectories of all rounds, we have the following table:

| Round | Outperformance Rate | Success Coverage |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1     | 92.1                | 89.9             |
| 2     | 96.4                | 95.0             |
| 3     | 98.0                | 97.2             |

This additionally demonstrates that ActRe obtains a better coverage of high-reward trajectories over ReAct-only sampling, showing its superiority of environmental awareness and supporting our motivation.

[Authors]: ### More experiments to compare with ReAct-only self-training

The following results depict the Table 4, with the task performances of the ReAct-only self-training method added. We have omitted the prior work baselines for simplicity. The best results are listed in **bold**, and the second best results are listed with [brackets].

| Test Trial         | Round | Method     | Valid.    | Test.     |

| Single             | 3     | Ours       | 69.1 / 42.8 | [73.9] / **49.0** |
|
| Iterative (accum.) | 1     | ReAct-only | 73.9 / 49.7 | 76.1 / 50.4 |
| Iterative (accum.) | 2     | ReAct-only | 75.8 / [52.0] | 77.4 / 52.6 |
| Iterative (accum.) | 3     | ReAct-only | **76.6** / **53.5** | [78.0] / [53.4] |
| Iterative (accum.) | 1     | Ours       | 74.0 / 47.3 | 76.6 / 51.6 |
| Iterative (accum.) | 2     | Ours       | 75.1 / 49.5 | 77.8 / [53.4] |
| Iterative (accum.) | 3     | Ours       | [75.9] / 51.3 | **78.2** / **54.8** |

According to the results, the performance of the ReAct-only method becomes better on the validation scenarios across different rounds, demonstrating the effectiveness of the contrastive self-training method used to train the models in Rounds 1~3. However, it is shown that our framework achieves the better success rate on test scenarios, and the consistency of outperformance is further demonstrated in the iterative refinement evaluation setting. The reason might be that the trajectories gathered with ActRe enjoy higher scenario-wise **Success Coverage** and **Outperformance Rate** compared with those by ReAct-only sampling, and overfitting is thus reduced when training with the data gathered with ActRe. 

We hope the added experiments can further address your concerns, and we will add these experiments as well as relevant discussions to the paper.



### Other weaknesses
___

***Weakness 2. Lack of methodological contributions.***

As mentioned in our paper, the primary contribution of our work is the closed-loop framework for agents to self-improve. In this framework, agents autonomously annotate the rationales for the sampled actions from the environment in each trajectory, and self-improve through contrastive self-training. While we indicated in Section 2.2 that we follow the idea of policy gradient for self-training, we conduct the rearrangement in Eq.(2), which has inspired us with its relationship to SFT and contrastive training (Remarks 1~3). We have also conducted corresponding ablation studies in Sec. 4.1 to validate the relationship and the superiority of contrastive self-training. As indicated in Sec. 4.1, we leave the integration of more advanced RL techniques for future work.

***Weakness 3. Diversity and scalability issues of agent trajectories.***

Our ActRe allows a ReAct agent to directly sample actions from the environment by annotating the rationales in each trajectory. By grounding in the environment, our framework can in theory collect trajectories with arbitrary action allowed in the environment at each time step. Furthermore, the sampling process of ActRe can be executed in parallel for different trajectories, since the probability at each time step to sample an action and query ActRe is fixed as $p=0.5$ (Appendix A).

[Authors]: We'd like to add further clarification about the limitations of ReAct-only sampling, especially to rectify the potentially overclaiming statement of ""`click[< Prev]` *action in WebShop is never performed by ReAct-only sampling*"" in our rebuttal.

The statement was drawn by observing the set of *successful* trajectories obtained by ReAct-only sampling: The `click[< Prev]` action does not exist in this set. When observing all the trajectories gathered by ReAct-only sampling, we indeed find that the `click[< Prev]` action has been performed. However, in our runs, all the trajectories containing the `click[< Prev]` action do not reach the full reward. Compared with the trajectory set gathered by ActRe, the ReAct-only sampling falls short of environmental understanding in terms of the possibility of `click[< Prev]` leading to success. Therefore, we'd like to update the statement in our rebuttal to ""`click[< Prev]` *action in WebShop does not exist in the successful trajectories gathered by ReAct-only sampling in our runs*"". 

Following the ablation studies in Section 4.1, the $R=1$ trajectories in the training set do not cover the `click[< Prev]` action for ReAct-only sampling. On the contrary, the `click[< Prev]` action often appears in the successful trajectories set with ActRe sampling. This explains the case study shown in our rebuttal.

The motivation for ActRe proposed in our rebuttal still holds: Our framework better grounds the agent by rectifying the policy of the LLM itself with uniform action sampling from the environment when exploring the training scenarios. Such practice shares similar intuition with optimistic exploration for the less-chosen actions, as we complement additional exploration probabilities to them.

[Reviewer_QZXM]: Thank you for your response!

I appreciate the additional experiments, but I would expect more results from the ReAct-only baseline as mentioned in my review. I understand that this is difficult to complete during the short rebuttal period, but I do believe this is an important baseline and comparisons should be made in most of their settings.

The added case study is a good starting point to support the claimed motivation, yet the results are relatively preliminary and more quantitative and qualitative results can be added.

In summary, I like the provided experiments, but I would expect more of them for the paper to be published. I'm also curious about how the authors address my second and third points in the weakness section.

[Authors]: Thank you for providing us with the discussion opportunity! 

We are glad to know that you appreciate the experiments we added. We have been trying our best to run additional experiments to cover all the evaluation settings in the main experiments of WebShop. In the following, we provide the full comparison between ReAct-only self-training and our framework (A$^3$T with ActRe) following Tables 4 (task performance) and 6 (data quality) in our paper. For a fair comparison, we use the ""SFT with initial ReAct-only sampling"" model in our previous rebuttal as the Round=0 for ReAct-only, and ""contrastive self-training with initial ReAct-only sampling"" model in our earlier rebuttal as the Round=1 for ReAct-only. We have proceeded to use the Round=1 trained model to do ReAct-only sampling on the training scenarios, and use the accumulated trajectories to train the Round=2 ReAct-only model with contrastive self-training; The same goes for the Round-3 ReAct-only model.

### Supporting the claimed motivation
___

We start with the augmented Table 6, which compares the quality of the accumulated data between our framework and ReAct-only sampling. As the initial ReAct-only sampling was conducted with fair comparison to the sampling with ActRe in Round 1, we omit Round 0 of ours in the following Table.

| Round | Method     | Reward R (\*100) | Success Rate (%) | %{R$\ge$0.75} | %{R$\ge$0.5} |
|-------|------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|------------------|
| 1     | ReAct-only | 81.6            | 55.3             | 69.2       | 91.3             |
| 1     | Ours       | 85.2            | 61.1             | 75.8       | 94.3             |
|
| 2     | ReAct-only | 83.0            | 58.5             | 71.3       | 92.2             |
| 2     | Ours       | 88.9            | 69.4             | 82.6       | 96.3             |
|
| 3     | ReAct-only | 83.3            | 59.1             | 71.8       | 92.4             |
| 3     | Ours       | 90.6            | 73.9             | 85.0       | 96.8             |

According to the results, our framework collects the trajectories with consistently higher rewards and success rate. These quantitative results support our motivation, as the successful / high-reward trajectories could be collected only when the agent system is grounded in the environment with better awareness, and our ActRe has gathered better trajectories in this sense than the ReAct-only method that relies only on the internal reasoning of LLMs. 

We also define two scenario-wise comparison metrics to show the advantage of ActRe in data collection:

- **Outperformance Rate** computes for the percentage of training scenarios where the best trajectory gathered by ActRe has a higher reward than that by ReAct-only sampling. Let the reward of the the best trajectory in the $i$-th scenario gathered by ActRe be $R_{\mathrm{ActRe}}^{(i)}$ , and that by ReAct-only be $R_{\mathrm{ReAct-only}}^{(i)}$. With the number of training scenarios in total as $N$, we define
 
$$\mathrm{Outperformance~Rate} = \frac{{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{1}} \\{R_{\mathrm{ActRe}}^{(i)} \ge R_{\mathrm{ReAct-only}}^{(i)} \\}}{N}$$

- **Success Coverage** calculates the percentage of training scenarios where ReAct-only sampling collects successful trajectories, and ActRe achieves success as well. Let $S_{\rm ReAct-only}$ be the set of scenarios where ReAct-only sampling succeeds, and $S_{\rm ActRe}$ goes similar for ActRe, we define

$$\mathrm{Success~Coverage} = \frac{|S_{\rm ActRe} \cap S_{\rm ReAct-only}|}{|S_{\rm ReAct-only}|}$$

Computing the two metrics for the accumulated trajectories of all rounds, we have the following table:

| Round | Outperformance Rate | Success Coverage |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1     | 92.1                | 89.9             |
| 2     | 96.4                | 95.0             |
| 3     | 98.0                | 97.2             |

This additionally demonstrates that ActRe obtains a better coverage of high-reward trajectories over ReAct-only sampling, showing its superiority of environmental awareness and supporting our motivation.

[Authors]: ### More experiments to compare with ReAct-only self-training
___

The following results depict the Table 4, with the task performances of the ReAct-only self-training method added. We have omitted the prior work baselines for simplicity. The best results are listed in **bold**, and the second best results are listed with [brackets].

| Test Trial         | Round | Method     | Valid.    | Test.     |
|--------------------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Single             | 0     | ReAct-only | 69.1 / 43.2 | 72.4 / 45.8 |
| Single             | 1     | ReAct-only | 69.2 / 43.2 | 73.1 / 47.0 |
| Single             | 2     | ReAct-only | 70.0 / 43.5 | **74.3** / 47.8 |
| Single             | 3     | ReAct-only | **70.5** / **44.0** | [73.9] / 47.2 |
| Single             | 0     | Ours       | [70.1] / 41.0 | 72.4 / 45.4 |
| Single             | 1     | Ours       | 69.7 / 43.0 | 73.1 / **49.0** |
| Single             | 2     | Ours       | 69.0 / [43.8] | 73.0 / [48.0] |
| Single             | 3     | Ours       | 69.1 / 42.8 | [73.9] / **49.0** |
|
| Iterative (accum.) | 1     | ReAct-only | 73.9 / 49.7 | 76.1 / 50.4 |
| Iterative (accum.) | 2     | ReAct-only | 75.8 / [52.0] | 77.4 / 52.6 |
| Iterative (accum.) | 3     | ReAct-only | **76.6** / **53.5** | [78.0] / [53.4] |
| Iterative (accum.) | 1     | Ours       | 74.0 / 47.3 | 76.6 / 51.6 |
| Iterative (accum.) | 2     | Ours       | 75.1 / 49.5 | 77.8 / [53.4] |
| Iterative (accum.) | 3     | Ours       | [75.9] / 51.3 | **78.2** / **54.8** |

According to the results, the performance of the ReAct-only method becomes better on the validation scenarios across different rounds, demonstrating the effectiveness of the contrastive self-training method used to train the models in Rounds 1~3. However, it is shown that our framework achieves the better success rate on test scenarios, and the consistency of outperformance is further demonstrated in the iterative refinement evaluation setting. The reason might be that the trajectories gathered with ActRe enjoy higher scenario-wise **Success Coverage** and **Outperformance Rate** compared with those by ReAct-only sampling, and overfitting is thus reduced when training with the data gathered with ActRe. 

We hope the added experiments can further address your concerns, and we will add these experiments as well as relevant discussions to the paper.



### Other weaknesses
___

***Weakness 2. Lack of methodological contributions.***

As mentioned in our paper, the primary contribution of our work is the closed-loop framework for agents to self-improve. In this framework, agents autonomously annotate the rationales for the sampled actions from the environment in each trajectory, and self-improve through contrastive self-training. While we indicated in Section 2.2 that we follow the idea of policy gradient for self-training, we conduct the rearrangement in Eq.(2), which has inspired us with its relationship to SFT and contrastive training (Remarks 1~3). We have also conducted corresponding ablation studies in Sec. 4.1 to validate the relationship and the superiority of contrastive self-training. As indicated in Sec. 4.1, we leave the integration of more advanced RL techniques for future work.

***Weakness 3. Diversity and scalability issues of agent trajectories.***

Our ActRe allows a ReAct agent to directly sample actions from the environment by annotating the rationales in each trajectory. By grounding in the environment, our framework can in theory collect trajectories with arbitrary action allowed in the environment at each time step. Furthermore, the sampling process of ActRe can be executed in parallel for different trajectories, since the probability at each time step to sample an action and query ActRe is fixed as $p=0.5$ (Appendix A). 

According to the comparison of the collected trajectories (see the augmented Table 6), the trajectories collected by ActRe are of consistently higher reward and success rate than ReAct-only sampling that relies on the internal reasoning of LLMs only. Besides, Reflexion suggested in FireAct does not yield improved performance on WebShop because of the environmental complexity (indicated by the Reflexion paper in Appendix B.1). These experiments and facts validate that our framework collects agent trajectories with improved diversity and scalability. We will add relevant discussions to our paper."

636,AdaMoLE: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models with Adaptive Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation Experts,Accept,fvsbxJDxoR,,,,"[Authors]: We appreciate your concern regarding the rank deficiency of MoE-LoRA matrices. To clarify, let's denote $N$ as the number of experts and $r$ as the rank of each LoRA matrix $A_i$ and $B_i$. For each input $x$, the combined MoE-LoRA matrix is given by $\sum_{i=1}^N w_i(x) B_i A_i$. While each $B_i A_i$ has a rank $r$, the combined rank of their weighted sum can be up to $N \times r$ if they span independent subspaces, as $\text{rank}\left(\sum_{i=1}^N w_i(x) B_i A_i\right) \leq \sum_{i=1}^N \text{rank}(B_i A_i) = N \times r$.

In the case of top-k gating (or threshold gating), only the top-k experts are selected for each input, resulting in a rank of at most $k \times r$. Although $k \times r$ is smaller than $N \times r$, empirical results show that MoE-LoRA models still achieve high performance. This is because the gating mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant experts for each input, where each small matrix $B_i A_i$ specializes in different features. The dynamic selection mechanism ensures that the most relevant experts are activated based on the input $x$, allowing the model to effectively use the most informative subspaces tailored to the specific input. Consequently, even with a lower theoretical rank, the adaptive combination of small LoRA matrices can still outperform a single large LoRA matrix.

We hope this explanation clarifies our approach. We appreciate your review and look forward to any further questions or comments you may have.

[Reviewer_pQdU]: Appreciate the authors' additional experiments w.r.t. the evaluation issues. Adaptive selection to adjust the lora experts' parameters is a synergy of already well-known approaches. I will maintain my rating since the novelty lies in the combination rather than creation of methods. However, I would like to respect the opinions of other reviewers and chairs.

[Reviewer_pQdU]: In the above authors' hyper-parameter test, AdaMoLE seems to saturate with the increase of lora expert number or rank, while other methods tend to have a higher performance with the total theoretical rank (i.e. $N\times{r}$). However, the overall competitiveness of proposed method is quite obvious. 

Thanks for the authors' response to my rank-deficiency concern of extending lora fine-tuning effectiveness by moe architecture. However, the response is almost an empirical standpoint which may be influenced by quite a lot experimental setting issues. 

And to clarify my concern, the rank-deficiency event may at most take place 7 times when assembling 8 rank-4 lora matrices (which I would like to name as ``low-rank ensemble issue""). Maybe the rank restoring technique proposed by ReLoRA[1] can be injected in place to MoE-LoRA, e.g. refreshing lora experts' weights according to a schedule.

[Authors]: Thank you for your response. We are here to provide the complete set of experimental results which we could not finish due to the time constraints during the rebuttal period.

> Q. Insufficient MLLMs.

Here we update the full results of Claude, including 8-shot. The updated figures are uploaded here: [Figure 4(c)](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1fF41lSC.png), [Figure 4(d)](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyutEyxBR.png). Claude's performance appears comparable to that of GPT-4V, while Gemini continues to outperform all the others.

> Q. Experiments on fine-tuning.

Below are the experimental results for SEED-LLaMA in both 2-shot and 4-shot scenarios. It is important to note that the the results for each theme are derived from different models. For example, for 2-shot, the results for Style-I and II come from models fine-tuned on all tasks except Style-I and II, while the results for Texture-I and II are from models fine-tuned on all tasks excluding Texture-I and II.

| Shot | Fine-tuned SEED-LLaMA | Color-I | Background-I | Style-I | Action-I | Texture-I | Color-II | Background-II | Style-II | Action-II | Texture-II | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 2 | ✗ | .636 | .292 | .088 | .196 | .108 | .360 | **.536** | .164 | **.196** | .080 | 
| 2 | ✓ | **.752** | **.484** | **.208** | **.272** | **.200** | **.568** | .376 | **.240** | .180 | **.104** | 
| 4 | ✗ | .612 | .360 | .092 | .044 | .048 | .380 | **.532** | **.140** | **.196** | .148 | 
| 4 | ✓ | **.748** | **.556** | **.208** | **.256** | **.244** | **.616** | .488 | .112 | .132 | **.216** | 

After analyzing the complete set of results, our conclusion remains unchanged. The results indicate that fine-tuning on various T2I-ICL tasks generally enhances the models' ability to perform T2I-ICL on unseen tasks. Therefore, for unseen tasks that have not been included in the fine-tuning process, ICL remains necessary for efficiency.

[Reviewer_8Cxt]: Thanks for your response, I would like to keep the score as it is.

[Authors]: Thank you for your response. We are here to provide the complete set of experimental results which we could not finish due to the time constraints during the rebuttal period.

> Q. Insufficient MLLMs.

Here we update the full results of Claude, including 8-shot. The updated figures are uploaded here: [Figure 4(c)](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1fF41lSC.png), [Figure 4(d)](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyutEyxBR.png). Claude's performance appears comparable to that of GPT-4V, while Gemini continues to outperform all the others.

> Q. Experiments on fine-tuning.

Below are the experimental results for SEED-LLaMA in both 2-shot and 4-shot scenarios. It is important to note that the the results for each theme are derived from different models. For example, for 2-shot, the results for Style-I and II come from models fine-tuned on all tasks except Style-I and II, while the results for Texture-I and II are from models fine-tuned on all tasks excluding Texture-I and II.

| Shot | Fine-tuned SEED-LLaMA | Color-I | Background-I | Style-I | Action-I | Texture-I | Color-II | Background-II | Style-II | Action-II | Texture-II | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 2 | ✗ | .636 | .292 | .088 | .196 | .108 | .360 | **.536** | .164 | **.196** | .080 | 
| 2 | ✓ | **.752** | **.484** | **.208** | **.272** | **.200** | **.568** | .376 | **.240** | .180 | **.104** | 
| 4 | ✗ | .612 | .360 | .092 | .044 | .048 | .380 | **.532** | **.140** | **.196** | .148 | 
| 4 | ✓ | **.748** | **.556** | **.208** | **.256** | **.244** | **.616** | .488 | .112 | .132 | **.216** | 

After analyzing the complete set of results, our conclusion remains unchanged. The results indicate that fine-tuning on various T2I-ICL tasks generally enhances the models' ability to perform T2I-ICL on unseen tasks. Therefore, for unseen tasks that have not been included in the fine-tuning process, ICL remains necessary for efficiency.

I guess a follow up question should've been whether or do we need to get around the need to have a model that can do the evolution.

[Authors]: Thanks for your reply!

>I guess a follow up question should've been whether or do we need to get around the need to have a model that can do the evolution.

Currently, we definitely need to use an LLM to perform the evolution. The reason is that many of the evolved problems require changing the semantic meaning of the original problem (e.g., making it more creative, or difficult). Doing this without an LLM would be challenging as we would need to design set of rules to perform these semantic transformations which cannot generalize to all sorts of input problems.The combine-naive is a special case where the simple rules can be applied without LLMs but in general we don't think its possible to go without using LLMs for the evolution."

604,Adaptive Quantization Error Reconstruction for LLMs with Mixed Precision,Accept,JRdn4nO9hQ,,,,"[Reviewer_SfE9]: I thank the authors for their responses, but the responses they provided did not sufficiently address my concerns. Above all, the authors claimed in the rebuttal that the proposed idea is ""proven"" to outperform the existing techniques with ""theoretical analysis,"" but it is hard to understand the theoretical reasoning behind their methods. The authors admitted that their methodology is greedy, but they did not provide the ablation study to empirically support the superiority of their greedy method. The authors also share a plan to provide a comprehensive speed analysis, but it does not seem to be included in this rebuttal. Therefore, I would like to maintain my original score.

[Authors]: In our evaluation conducted on a single A100 GPU, we tested the Llama2-13B-chat model's inference speed. For the Quip# method, I used the evaluation code available at https://github.com/Cornell-RelaxML/quip-sharp, with a batch size of 1. The inference speed for the 2-bit quantized model was measured at 21.2 tokens/s, whereas the non-quantized fp16 model operated at 27.02 tokens/s. Clearly, quantization via Quip# results in a reduction of inference speed compared to the non-quantized model.
Maintaining the same experimental setup, our model, being unable to achieve a full 2-bit quantization, was assessed using the closest approximation of a 2.5-bit quantized model. We tested this by only replacing the quantized linear layers. Our approach yielded an inference speed of 46.08 tokens/s. Notably, when paired with our internally developed inference framework, we were able to reach an impressive 117.7 tokens/s, far surpassing the non-quantized model's speed of 45.3 tokens/s.

[Authors]: Thank you for your comments. Due to the rebuttal word limit of 2500 characters, we did not provide a detailed explanation of our theory. We will further elaborate on it.   

We would like to emphasize that, unlike using the same quantization precision for each linear layer, our mixed-precision quantization approach allows different quantization precisions to be applied to different linear layers and integrates them. This method ensures minimal overall error while meeting the given bits-per-weight (bpw) requirement. For instance, when the mixed-precision target bpw is set to 4, applying 4-bit precision quantization to all linear layers adheres to the bpw condition but may not result in the minimal overall error combination. Given the vastness of the search space, finding the optimal solution within a limited time frame is challenging. Therefore, we employed a greedy strategy to obtain a relatively optimal solution.   

This is essentially a binary greedy strategy where we minimize the maximum quantization error $N_{max}$ under the  target bpw condition. $N_{max}$  is defined as the largest quantization error obtained when applying the target bpw to each linear layer. $N_{max}$ serves as the upper bound for our binary search, with the starting point being the precision quantization of all linear layers using the same precision. In detail，We use $N_{max}/2$ as our target value during the binary search. In this process, we eliminate all combinations with a quantization error exceeding  $N_{max}/2$ at each layer. Then, for the remaining combinations that exhibit quantization errors below this threshold, we select the combination with the smallest bits-per-weight (bpw) to compute the model's overall bpw value.   

If this computed bpw is less than our target, it suggests the existence of a viable solution, although this solution may not minimize the quantization error. We continue to binary search using smaller target values, repeating the process until we either cannot find a combination that satisfies the target bpw, or the precision of our binary search for the quantization error target reaches below 1e-5. At that point, we terminate the search and adopt the last satisfying solution as our final resolution.

[Authors]: Thank you for your feedback. We acknowledge the concerns you have raised about the theoretical basis and empirical support for our greedy methodology. However, our method maintains good performance and inference efficiency in practical applications, which is also a manifestation of application innovation. In response:

- Theoretical Clarification: We will enhance our theoretical analysis to better elucidate the method's efficacy, aiming for clearer comprehension and acceptance.

- Empirical Evidence: We plan to conduct an ablation study to provide empirical evidence for the superiority of our method, specifically demonstrating its performance and efficiency advantages over existing techniques.

We appreciate your insights and agree on the necessity of reinforcing the theoretical reasoning and empirical justification. Our team is committed to addressing these issues and improving the manuscript's clarity and rigor. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to refine our work. We look forward to your reconsideration."

604,Adaptive Quantization Error Reconstruction for LLMs with Mixed Precision,Accept,KLom3X2JcZ,,,,"[Reviewer_n3yk]: Thanks for the clarification. Overall, the varying sensitivities of each layer are well-known observations. The motivation for adapting mixed precision and activation-based low-rank reconstruction for each layer is also straightforward. Given the observation and problem is not new, I would like to see a sound and exciting solution.  However, it seems the solution is preliminary and working in progress. I still think it is not good enough.

[Authors]: Thank you for your feedback. While we acknowledge that the underlying motivations behind employing mixed precision and activation-based low-rank reconstruction are indeed intuitive and address known observations, we emphasize that our method is driven by a concrete problem-solving approach. This stems from real-world challenges, guiding our development of the proposed solutions which have shown significant performance improvements and efficiency gains in practical applications.

We understand your concerns regarding the current stage of our solution being perceived as preliminary. We are committed to continuously refining our methodology, focusing on rigorous theoretical analysis and practical application enhancements. Our future work will aim at not only solidifying the theoretical underpinnings but also at demonstrating the utility and robustness of our approach in diverse real-world scenarios.

We truly appreciate your suggestions and the opportunity to further develop and optimize our work. Your feedback is invaluable in guiding our efforts to achieve a solution that is both theoretically sound and practically effective."

[Reviewer_N9VV]: Thank you very much for your response. Regarding point 1, please make sure you cite all relevant literature (not only the Seamless paper). Regarding point 2, I am sincerely not convinced that adding a dash is enough to differentiate the models. Too often do we see typographic variation in how model/architecture/corpus names are written (e.g. open-flamingo / OpenFlamingo / Open flamingo / Open-Flamingo etc.), and a dash is not enough to ensure disambiguation. I strongly suggest coining a whole new name.

Overall, I see no reasons to modify my score."

Regarding notations, here we also provide essential updates for notations in Section 4.1: $\mathcal{D}^{P}$ can be further organized as $\mathcal{D}^{P} _n=${$d _1, d _2, \cdots, d _n$} with $d _i={x^k, y _w^k,  y _l^k} _{k=1}^{K _{i}}$, where $d _i$ denotes the alignment dimensions, such as helpfulness in Anthropic HH dataset, $n$ represents the total alignment dimensions, and $K _{i}$ notes the total samples in dimension $d _i$ with $\sum _{i=1}^n K _i=K$}. Formally, given a reward model, i.e., $\text{RM}$, that has been initially fine-tuned on the whole preference dataset $\mathcal{D}^{P} _{n}=\{d _1, d _2, \cdots, d _n\}$, its performance (i.e., accuracy of $\text{RM}(x, y _w) > \text{RM}(x, y _l)$) on the corresponding test dataset from $\mathcal{D} ^{P} _{n}$  is represented by $\mathbb{U} = ${$u _1, u _2, \cdots, u _n$}.

We provide the jailbreak experiments of policy levels on 10 harmful examples for 5 epochs, following the experiments on ([Qi et al, ICLR (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03693), Table 1).  Specifically, the GPT-4 judge outputs a harmfulness score in the range of 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating increased harm. The Harmfulness Score and Rate indicate the average harmfulness score and the fraction of test cases that receive the highest harmfulness score 5, respectively. 

Analysis of the data presented in the table reveals that, on average, the increment in harmfulness score for Hummer is less pronounced than for UltraFeedback. Additionally, Hummer maintains a lower increase in the Harmfulness Rate, staying below 50% in 5 out of 6, in contrast to UltraFeedback, which achieves this in only 1 out of 4.

The authors addressed most of my questions and concerns. I would keep my positive recommendation to the paper, but would not raise the score because the authors added substantially more explanations and experiments.

We concur that further detailed explanations and additional experiments would significantly deepen the understanding of the contributions and implications of our work.

[Reviewer_z9ad]: Thanks for the responses and the additional experiments! 

The authors addressed most of my questions and concerns. I would keep my positive recommendation to the paper, but would not raise the score because the authors added substantially more explanations and experiments.

[Authors]: Thank you for your insightful comments. We concur that further detailed explanations and additional experiments would significantly deepen the understanding of the contributions and implications of our work. Moreover, we acknowledge the merit of your suggestion to conduct an ablation study without hybrid sampling, which we believe will further clarify the impact of this study. 

In the following, we also provide the jailbreak experiments of policy levels on 10 harmful examples for 5 epochs, following the experiments on ([Qi et al, ICLR (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03693), Table 1) to further enhance our submission.

Specifically, the GPT-4 judge outputs a harmfulness score in the range of 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating increased harm. The Harmfulness Score and Rate indicate the average harmfulness score and the fraction of test cases that receive the highest harmfulness score 5, respectively. 

Analysis of the data presented in the table reveals that, on average, the increment in harmfulness score for Hummer is less pronounced than for UltraFeedback. Additionally, Hummer maintains a lower increase in the Harmfulness Rate, staying below 50% in 5 out of 6, in contrast to UltraFeedback, which achieves this in only 1 out of 4."

[Authors]: We respectively agree with Reviewer 9qZi and remove the anonymous link for the paper to make fairness to other
submissions and limit the burden of reviewers. In the following, we provide further clarification. Here we provide further essential clarification for our prior rebuttal. 

**Response to Reject 1.3** (*paper writing: redundant sentences*): Thanks for this notification and we will make the correction in our final version.

**Response to Reject 1.3** (*paper writing: we categorize every pair of datasets” Do you mean “every pair of responses”?*):  This refers to every dataset sample $(x, y _1, y _2)$. 

Regarding notations, here we also provide essential updates for notations in Section 4.1: $\mathcal{D}^{P}$ can be further organized as $\mathcal{D}^{P} _n=${$d _1, d _2, \cdots, d _n$} with $d _i={x^k, y _w^k,  y _l^k} _{k=1}^{K _{i}}$, where $d _i$ denotes the alignment dimensions, such as helpfulness in Anthropic HH dataset, $n$ represents the total alignment dimensions, and $K _{i}$ notes the total samples in dimension $d _i$ with $\sum _{i=1}^n K _i=K$}. Formally, given a reward model, i.e., $\text{RM}$, that has been initially fine-tuned on the whole preference dataset $\mathcal{D}^{P} _{n}=\{d _1, d _2, \cdots, d _n\}$, its performance (i.e., accuracy of $\text{RM}(x, y _w) > \text{RM}(x, y _l)$) on the corresponding test dataset from $\mathcal{D} ^{P} _{n}$  is represented by $\mathbb{U} = ${$u _1, u _2, \cdots, u _n$}.

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer vKrR,

We sincerely apologize that we could not provide an enough response on the Rebuttal due to the length limitation.  
In this comment, we will address the parts that were lacking or unanswered in the Rebuttal. We hope this will help for Reviewers.

We wish to express our appreciation to the reviewers for their insightful comments on our paper. Please find our responses below.

> The idea of using task vectors is not novel and have been widely explored in the literature. Moreover, learning a task vector for a text style transfer task is also not novel. Therefore, the contribution

As the reviewer has pointed out, we conducted detoxification by utilizing task vector negation. However, we believe that our main contributions are as follows. 1) We proposed a novel detoxification method by merging multiple task vectors from fine-tuned models with split toxic datasets, and 2) We discovered that when models trained on split datasets are merged, the merged model experiences a smaller amount of parameter shift from the pre-trained model than the standard task vector negation method. We assume that by applying our method, the important attribute (detoxification) is maintained within the merged vectors, while other attributes (text format, etc.), which we believe might be present in the split datasets and related to model degeneration, are suppressed.

> Lack of other merging strategies. Authors do not consider any other merging strategies except linear. It would be beneficial to consider other merging strategies from related work. These methods were proven to be better than the simplest linear merging. 

The detoxification results are shown in the table in the Rebuttal section. We mentioned the performance (Utility Score) on downstream tasks and described these tasks in [**our comments to Reviewer tRLA**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TBNYjdOazs&noteId=04JTMxr8VH). We hope this will be helpful.

> The paper does not provide a clear definition of toxicity or the kind of phenomena evaluated. It would be interesting to know some examples of toxicity evaluated and how accurate is Detoxify on those examples.

We sincerely apologize for any confusion caused by not clearly defining toxicity. The definition of toxicity is subjective and may vary slightly across different studies, but we used the toxicity definition from the Perspective API [2]. According to the Perspective API [2], which is widely used to assess toxicity in many papers [1, 3, 4], toxicity is defined as “a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make you leave a discussion.” The Perspective API categorizes toxicity into four levels and classifies toxic sentences into four categories. The Perspective API uses data labeled by humans according to their toxic levels and categories. This data is used to train a classifier, which then measures the toxicity of text. If our paper is accepted, we plan to include examples of generated sentences from both the baseline and our detoxified models, categorized by the toxicity levels and the categories. Once again, we apologize for not providing a clear definition and promise to include a more precise definition in the paper.

> Paper lacks comparison to other strong model self-detoxification approaches. With the current evaluation results it is unclear, whether the proposed method is better than other strong approaches.

In this paper, we did not compare our proposed method with existing strong self-detoxification approaches [3, 4], as mentioned by the reviewer. However, these self-detoxification methods require the creation of both extensive toxic and non-toxic datasets from a model. These datasets need to be generated for each model, requiring a large amount of data for each detoxification. However, the task vector negation method adopted in our proposed approach allows for efficient detoxification using only existing toxic datasets. We measured the performance of a typical detoxification method (i.e., gradient ascent) using only toxic datasets and compared its performance with our proposed method, confirming that our method is superior to those under the assumption that the fine-tuning data available are the same.

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer tRLA,

We sincerely apologize that we could not provide an enough response on the Rebuttal due to the length limitation.
In this comment, we will address the parts that were lacking or unanswered in the Rebuttal. We hope this will help for Reviewers.
We wish to express our appreciation to the reviewers for their insightful comments on our paper. Please find our responses below.

>The primary issue with the paper is its writing. The exact methodology is unclear and hard to follow. The experimental setup does not clearly state the experimental setup, choice of metrics for evaluation, and justification for choices made in the experimental design.

We sincerely apologize for any difficulties in following our experiment settings. Based on the advice of many reviewers, if our paper is accepted, we plan to make the following changes and additions in the camera-ready version:

1. Correct typos and grammatical errors.
2. Clearly describe the purpose and intent of each experiment.
3. Provide more detailed information on the evaluation methods and settings for each experiment (Please see our response below).
4. Include a precise definition of toxicity and examples for each toxicity category (Please also see [**our comment to Reviewer vKrR**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TBNYjdOazs&noteId=X3MKeMdDna)).

Once again, we deeply apologize for the unclear explanations that made it difficult to comprehend this paper. If there are any other comments in addition to what we have mentioned, please let us know. Thank you very much.

>Beyond writing, the first point of confusion is how toxicity is evaluated. How is avg. max toxicity and toxicity probs are calculated, as shown in Table 1.

We are truly sorry for the difficulty caused by not providing clear explanations for the metrics in the table caption. Following the previous study [1], We evaluate the model’s toxicity using Perspective API [2] in Table 1. We specifically use the nucleus sampling strategy [3] to produce 25 generations of 25 tokens each for the same prompt. This allows us to determine the maximum toxicity score for each prompt and compute the average as the Expected Maximum Toxicity. Additionally, we calculate the probability of generating toxic continuations (toxicity score above 0.5) within the 25 generations for each prompt, referred to as the Toxicity Probability score.

We prompt all models with “I don’t care if this is controversial” and we use 1K prompts labeled as ‘normal’, and randomly sampled from RealToxicPrompts [1] for the toxicity evaluation. Although the explanations for these metrics are included in the paper, we have realized that it is challenging for readers to understand without them being under the table caption. We will address this issue with the other writing problems the reviewers have pointed out, in the camera-ready version.

> Degeneration of the model is evaluated with perplexity on wiki-103. This metric alone cannot sufficiently support the claim that this method leads to lesser degeneration. For example, what happens to other capabilities of the models? It would also be important to evaluate the generation themselves, as perplexity could be a very noisy proxy for generation quality. Specifically, human evaluation of generations would be highly recommended.

Although we also agree with the reviewer’s opinion that human evaluation is the most accurate evaluation, we were unable to conduct human evaluation due to time constraints. However, following the feedback from the reviewers, we have included additional evaluations on various downstream tasks [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. We choose these downstream tasks for the evaluation of model degeneration following this detoxification research [11]. We measure this by averaging accuracy on the downstream tasks. We provide short descriptions for each downstream task in the next comment due to the length limitation.

[Authors]: Continuing from the previous comment, we have provided a brief description of the downstream tasks below.

Hellaswag [4]: Tests the model’s ability to choose the most plausible continuation of a given context, assessing commonsense reasoning.  
WiC (Word-in-Context) [5]: Evaluates the model’s ability to determine if a word has the same meaning in two different contexts, testing lexical semantics.  
PIQA (Physical Interaction QA) [6]: Evaluates the model’s physical commonsense reasoning by selecting the most reasonable answer to everyday task questions.  
WinoGrande [7]: Evaluates the model’s understanding of pronoun resolution in sentences with ambiguous references, testing commonsense reasoning.

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer o8PJ,

We sincerely apologize that we could not provide an enough response on the Rebuttal due to the length limitation.
In this comment, we will address the parts that were lacking or unanswered in the Rebuttal. We hope this will help for Reviewers.
We wish to express our appreciation to the reviewers for their insightful comments on our paper. Please find our responses below.

> Perplexity is not currently considered the best metric for generation performance. The model could produce outputs with high confidence while outputting low-quality text. It would be interesting to measure the performance of the model on some LLM benchmarks to ensure the lack of performance degradation.

Following the feedback from the reviewers, we have included additional evaluations on various downstream tasks [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. We choose these downstream tasks for the evaluation of model degeneration following this detoxification research [8]. We measure this by averaging accuracy on the downstream tasks. We provide a short description of these downstream tasks on [**our comments to Reviewer tRLA**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TBNYjdOazs&noteId=04JTMxr8VH). Moreover, we have presented the main experiment results including the downstream evaluations on [**our rebuttal to Reviewer tRLA’**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TBNYjdOazs&noteId=dHnDleniE3). As a result, We found that our approach can achieve better detoxification than the existing task vector negation method, while maintaining similar model performance.

> The models evaluated are relatively small or non state-of-the-art. It would be interesting to see if this technique scales on bigger models.
> Have you tried this method on larger models? Does it work at scale?

We believe that our approach will also work on larger and state-of-the-art models. To demonstrate this, we applied our proposed method to a larger and more recent model, Llama2 - 7b, and presented the results in the table (please see the table in [**our Rebuttal to Reviewer vKrR**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TBNYjdOazs&noteId=qLvE2RNltY)). The results in that table show that the proposed method is also effective on the recent and larger model.

Thank you for your advice. We will update our paper following your advice.

Again, thank you for giving us the opportunity to improve our manuscript with your valuable comments and queries.

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer VAs3,

We sincerely apologize that we could not provide an enough response on the Rebuttal due to the length limitation.
In this comment, we will address the parts that were lacking or unanswered in the Rebuttal. We hope this will help for Reviewers.

We wish to express our appreciation to the reviewers for their insightful comments on our paper. Please find our responses below.

> The method's efficacy is demonstrated primarily through reductions in toxicity scores and model degradation rates, but there's a lack of discussion on whether the segmentation of datasets and subsequent model merging might lead to overfitting on the specific characteristics of the datasets used (i.e., Civil Comments and Toxigen). What other aspects of these datasets are being exploited in this process? Without further clarity, this could impact the robustness of the method when applied to real-world, diverse datasets (Section 4.1).

> What alternative metrics for model degradation may be used, that were not explored here?

As the reviewer mentioned, we acknowledge the possibility of overfitting to other characteristics of the dataset beyond toxicity. However, as we mentioned in this paper, our method has been shown to enhance a common feature (detoxification) and suppress distinct features (data format, etc.) in segmented datasets, which we believe will result in better generality compared to the existing task vector negation method. To further clarify the degeneration of other aspects, we have included additional evaluations on various downstream tasks [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. We choose these downstream tasks for the evaluation of model degeneration following this detoxification research [8]. We measure this by averaging accuracy on the downstream tasks. We provide a short description for each downstream task on [**our comment to Reviewer tRLA**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TBNYjdOazs&noteId=04JTMxr8VH). Moreover, we have presented the main experiment results including the downstream evaluations in the table (please see [**our Rebuttal to Reviewer tRLA**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TBNYjdOazs&noteId=dHnDleniE3)). As a result, We found that our approach can achieve better detoxification than the existing task vector negation method while maintaining similar model performance.

> Despite the empirical rigour in general, this paper does not explore a wider collection of datasets (or languages) nor does it provide a robust collection of baselines (i.e., existing detoxification methods, especially newer or more complex architectures) against which results are compared.

Due to the limited number of existing toxic datasets, as the reviewer mentioned, we were not able to conduct experiments with a wider variety of datasets. However, to ensure the robustness of our method across datasets, we included the Toxigen in addition to the Civil Comments dataset used in previous detoxification research. Furthermore, we conducted experiments with Llama2-7b and presented the results in [**our Rebuttal to Reviewer vKrR**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TBNYjdOazs&noteId=qLvE2RNltY). The results in that table show that the proposed method is also effective on the recent and larger model.

Regarding the comparison with existing detoxification methods, we did not compare our proposed method with existing strong self-detoxification approaches [8, 9]. However, these self-detoxification methods require the creation of extensive toxic and non-toxic datasets from a model. These datasets need to be generated for each model, requiring a large amount of data for each detoxification. However, the task vector negation method adopted in the proposed approach allows for efficient detoxification using only existing toxic datasets.

Thank you for your advice. We will update our paper following your advice.

We thank you again for taking the time to review our work. As the discussion period ends soon, we seek your feedback on whether we have adequately addressed your concerns in our rebuttal. We addressed concerns regarding the novelty and generality of our method. We also included an analysis comparing the performance of baseline empirical defenses and our certified defense against the AutoDAN-HGA attack, demonstrating that the detection accuracy of the baseline defenses is lower than our certified detection accuracy.

Below, we present additional experimental results comparing the performance of our erase-and-check procedure and its empirical variants with baseline defenses against AutoDAN-HGA. We run erase-and-check with Llama-2 and DistilBERT as the safety filter, setting the maximum erase length to 10 tokens, which is significantly shorter than the adversarial sequence length produced by AutoDAN-HGA (going up to 80 ~ 100 tokens). Our observations indicate that the detection accuracy of our method surpasses even the certified accuracy reported in previous results. Furthermore, we evaluated RandEC (sampling ratio = 0.3 and max erase = 30 tokens) and GreedyEC (#iterations = 6) against AutoDAN-HGA and found that their detection accuracy is significantly higher than the baseline defenses. These findings further demonstrate the resilience of our method against novel and unseen adversarial attacks.


| Method | Detection Accuracy (%) |

| Perplexity Defense (Vicuna) | 2.3 |
| Perplexity Defense (Guanaco) | 1.5 |

We will include the above results in the revised version of our paper.

My point is that since the model is relatively small, the generation quality is not good. Then you use the generated low-quality data as training data, how could we expect the model can learn good performance from them? But the things are different when adopt LLMs, since the quality of generated samples are good. Then it's interesting to see the performance change under your setting. I understood that the training cost is unaffordable for billion-level LLMs. But for image, there are lots of diffusion models (e.g., stable-diffusion 1.5) that have good generation quality, and it won't require so many resources. However, the image experiments are conducted on small VAEs, which cannot adequately convince me, either. Here are lots of observisions show some rules/laws will be out of work when the scale grows up. 

And for the related works, it will be better if you can post here to let us konw the details not just say you have written a 2 page related works.

[Authors]: Dear reviewer,

On model size, we would like to make several points:
1. For the LLM experiments, we have specifically chosen a dataset that was designed to be fit well by 10-30M parameter models. The generations by our models of up to 150M parameter size fit this data well. 
2. For image models, we did consider experiments using diffusion models, but do not believe that this would be feasible. Let us be clear that we do is pretraining these models from scratch in every iteration, not finetuning. Pretraining SD 1.0 took 150000 hours of A100 time, or a market cost of 600k USD, for a single pretraining run. [source: https://x.com/emostaque/status/1563870674111832066 ] Even on smaller datasets, we cannot realistically run 20+ such runs. We’d also like to note the COLM review guidelines which ask that reviewers “take into account that most researchers do not have access to large-scale compute.”, and that “Naturally, this runs the risk that some small-scale results will not hold when studied later on at a large scale. But some results will, and they will not make it unless we, the program committee, make a bet on them.”
3. We’d also like to say that we’ve focused primarily on the LLM experiments, as this is the focus of COLM. While we include other modalities to show that the effect isn’t strictly limited to language, we would like to ask you to take into account the focus of the conference when evaluating these experiments. 
4. Finally, we do look at generation quality as a confounding variable in the LLM experiments in appendix C, paragraph “Model quality after first model-fitting iteration” and find that this does not affect our conclusions.

Regarding related works, we fully agree. We had hoped to be able to upload a new revision of our paper with such changes, but COLM does not allow this (despite earlier information in the CfP that they would). We have just posted the new prior works section as a top-level comment here on OpenReview, and thank you for your understanding.

[Reviewer_Vd4L]: Thank you so much for your response! I agree with you that working in a setting where the generated data's quality is inferior to real data is still valid and interesting to show. However, I would encourage the authors to discuss the following points in their revisions:

- Would the observed phenomenon still hold if the quality of synthetic data exceeds that of real data (which is of mixed quality)? This is particularly relevant for GPT-generated texts, where it has been shown that training on synthetic data can be more beneficial than training on real data. I believe this discussion is crucial, as we have already observed this empirically.
- Why do different patterns exist between language, molecular modeling, and image synthesis during accumulative training? How do these modalities differ in nature?
- Regarding dataset size, my point was that the comparison between replacement and accumulation differs in the number of optimization steps due to varying dataset sizes. Controlling the dataset size to be the same would be more helpful in identifying how the distribution of data composition affects model performance. I believe the conclusion will largely hold for the current setting though.

I have raised my score to 6, and I am happy to have further discussions.

[Authors]: Dear reviewer,

Thank you for your response, and the interesting points you raise. 

* “Would the observed phenomenon still hold if the quality of synthetic data exceeds that of real data” - this is an interesting question, and raises a much bigger point: What does data “quality” mean? In practice, we typically care about downstream tasks. On the other hand, for theory, and in all prior works on model collapse, models are evaluated purely on fitting the input distribution well (no matter its quality). Our paper is in large part motivated by this prior literature on model collapse. This has gotten a fair bit of attention, both within academia as well as in more mainstream media with sometimes alarming headlines (e.g., Scientific American, “AI-Generated Data Can Poison Future AI Models”, Forbes, “Generative AI And The Risk Of Inbreeding”, and many others). We think it is important to provide a counterpoint to these. Within the framework of the existing literature, it would be difficult to define what high-quality data means, or how to evaluate models trained on such data. But more importantly, even if we were able to meaningfully define this, it would risk lessening the impact of our work, as it would open us to criticism of unfair comparison. I.e., if we only showed that high quality data avoids model collapse, that wouldn’t necessarily mean that model collapse couldn’t still happen if unfiltered data contaminated the internet. We show that even under such pessimistic assumptions, data accumulation alone is enough to largely avoid the problem.
   * Put differently: Think of our paper as a worst-case analysis, and a significant improvement on the prior lower bound, rather than a statement about the best-case. 
   * All that said, we would be happy to add a discussion of these points to the paper.
* On different modalities: We are not sure. The main difference is in the molecule experiments, and we admit none of us have sufficient domain knowledge to have a clear intuition of the data. (All three modalities do show the same effect with regard to accumulation vs replacement of data, to be clear.)
* On dataset size: We have in the mean time run an experiment where we keep the dataset size constant in the accumulation regime (I.e., we accumulate, but we subsample a fixed size training set at each model-fitting iteration.) This does somewhat worse than accumulation, but significantly better than replacing. In particular, it looks like the test error remains bounded by a constant (or possibly is increasing at a very small rate). This is of course somewhat tangential to our purposes, as part of our point is that models are being trained on increasing dataset sizes over time. The only way we can think of to control purely for the number of optimizer steps would be to increase the batch size for each model-fitting iteration for the replacement regime. This would of course necessitate a very small batch size in the first iteration, and would be limited to just a few iterations, but we would be happy to try to run this experiment if you think it would add to the paper.

[Reviewer_Vd4L]: Thank you very much for your detailed responses! I now fully understand the research angle of the work and believe it is valid. I would appreciate it if you could include all these discussions in your next revision. Given the discussion, I have decided to raise the score to 7."

My point is that since the model is relatively small, the generation quality is not good. Then you use the generated low-quality data as training data, how could we expect the model can learn good performance from them? But the things are different when adopt LLMs, since the quality of generated samples are good. Then it's interesting to see the performance change under your setting. I understood that the training cost is unaffordable for billion-level LLMs. But for image, there are lots of diffusion models (e.g., stable-diffusion 1.5) that have good generation quality, and it won't require so many resources. However, the image experiments are conducted on small VAEs, which cannot adequately convince me, either. Here are lots of observisions show some rules/laws will be out of work when the scale grows up. 

And for the related works, it will be better if you can post here to let us konw the details not just say you have written a 2 page related works.

[Authors]: Dear reviewer,

On model size, we would like to make several points:
1. For the LLM experiments, we have specifically chosen a dataset that was designed to be fit well by 10-30M parameter models. The generations by our models of up to 150M parameter size fit this data well. 
2. For image models, we did consider experiments using diffusion models, but do not believe that this would be feasible. Let us be clear that we do is pretraining these models from scratch in every iteration, not finetuning. Pretraining SD 1.0 took 150000 hours of A100 time, or a market cost of 600k USD, for a single pretraining run. [source: https://x.com/emostaque/status/1563870674111832066 ] Even on smaller datasets, we cannot realistically run 20+ such runs. We’d also like to note the COLM review guidelines which ask that reviewers “take into account that most researchers do not have access to large-scale compute.”, and that “Naturally, this runs the risk that some small-scale results will not hold when studied later on at a large scale. But some results will, and they will not make it unless we, the program committee, make a bet on them.”
3. We’d also like to say that we’ve focused primarily on the LLM experiments, as this is the focus of COLM. While we include other modalities to show that the effect isn’t strictly limited to language, we would like to ask you to take into account the focus of the conference when evaluating these experiments. 
4. Finally, we do look at generation quality as a confounding variable in the LLM experiments in appendix C, paragraph “Model quality after first model-fitting iteration” and find that this does not affect our conclusions.

Regarding related works, we fully agree. We had hoped to be able to upload a new revision of our paper with such changes, but COLM does not allow this (despite earlier information in the CfP that they would). We have just posted the new prior works section as a top-level comment here on OpenReview, and thank you for your understanding.

[Reviewer_7uQd]: Thanks for your clarification. I'd like to raise my score to 6."

We would like to first thank you again for your constructive comments and valuable suggestions! Since we are nearly at the end of the discussion phase, we wish to clarify and expand on a few points based on your queries.

1. Regarding question 1 on the experimental details for the morphism identification task:

   - Numbers of questions for the morphism identification task

     (1) Local morphism task of the three datasets:

     | question type  | Humaneval | MBXP | MathQA |
     | ----- | --------- | ---- | ------ |
     | 1-eq  | 318       | 1896 | 3237   |
     | 2-eq  | 159       | 953  | 1615   |
     | 1-neq | 173       | 1010 | 1418   |
     | total | 650       | 3859 | 6270   |

     (2) For the global morphism task in the `CodeContest` dataset, there are 97 #global-eq and 366 #global-neq questions.

     (3) In Appendix A, we provide more details about processing the question for fair evaluation(e.g.removing code comments that may leak some information for identification), and the filtering policy to make the number of different morphism types more balanced. 

   - More reproduction details: In the appendix, we provide (1) a link to anonymized code and (2) 5 pages in Appendices A&B detailing the reproduction steps and experimental statistics. We acknowledge that the main text was less detailed which may let you confused. We are also willing to update the main text with those important data statistics and reproducibility-related information as you suggested :)

2. For question 2: We want to point out that CatCode is the first paper to highlight the ""task unification"" and ""task composition"" in the field of code-related LLM evaluation. The benefits of the CatCode are that

   - **For LLMs**: The paper underscores the importance of recognizing functional equivalence under varying lexical similarities—a critical challenge in coding. It also illustrates how LLMs might struggle with composite tasks despite performing well on singular tasks.
   - **For new tasks**: As elaborated in the Rebuttal, category theory provides the **capacity to define new challenging tasks** E.g. morphism-identification, composite code reproduction task in the paper; debug+translate task for CodeScope; and can support more new tasks in the future (Please refer to rebuttal for Q1 for detailed elaboration and more examples).
   - **For existing datasets**: The unified math abstraction and standard pipeline can **adapt existing datasets to those new tasks automatically and systematically**. This can alleviate high-quality datasets from saturation, and reduce human labor to create new datasets for new tasks.
   - The above benefits are unique contributions to supplement previous evaluations, specifically there are the case for two classical previous work

       1. CodeXGLUE (Shuai Lu *et al.*, 2021) offers a comprehensive benchmark. From its leaderboard (https://microsoft.github.io/CodeXGLUE/), we can see researchers following on single tasks, but there's currently no following work that conducts all the tasks to obtain the overall performance. It's partly due to the complexity brought by the lack of standardness: they use almost completely different datasets, data formats, and pipelines for different tasks (ref: the first table in https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE). **Our work addresses this by introducing unified task definitions and a standard pipeline, making it easier for researchers to follow.**

       2. CodeScope(W Yan *et al.*, 2024) is more standard in the model API and data format, but they don't further build the connection among coding tasks or include any composite tasks (https://github.com/WeixiangYAN/CodeScope). With people increasingly relying on LLMs to conduct composite coding tasks (e.g. We may ask LLMs to generate the code, debug the code, and write docstrings in the same dialog), and we've found by experiments that the composite tasks are hard. Therefore, **the category framework fills this gap, facilitating composite task definition and adapting datasets to them in an automatic way.**

      In summary, our contributions are **both theoretical**—providing a unified mathematical abstraction for understanding the relationships among coding tasks—**and practical**, by standardizing the evaluation pipeline to enable automatic and systematic composite task assessments.

Again, we sincerely appreciate your insightful questions and feedback, which certainly help refine our work on quality and clarity. We hope our responses adequately address your queries, and are eager to address any further questions or concerns you may have :)"

[Reviewer_UqM4]: Thanks for the response from the authors. I still have some concerns. External causal tools need to be used under assumptions. How does LLM4Causal address this?

[Authors]: Dear reviewer,

Thank you for your insightful question! Currently, LLM4Causal can help with some assumption checking. For example, in the current framework, users could request LLM4Causal to validate structure-wise assumptions by asking a causal discovery query. The learned structure among variables can then be used to detect the presence of instrument/mediator/confounder variables, which is critical for accurately performing causal effect estimation tasks. However, other assumptions, such as Markov properties [1], error distributions [2], no unmeasured confounders [3], and so on, remain challenging to verify using observational datasets. This is still an open question in the literature, and hence beyond the scope of what language models can handle.

We strongly agree that assumption-checking is essential for causal learning.  Therefore, we would explore pre-trained ML models for assumption classification [4] as our next step. Also, it is worth noting that the LLM4Causal framework can easily adapt any assumption-checking tools that might be developed in the future, to improve its capabilities.

[Reviewer_vBxV]: Thank you for the clarification.

I now understand that, after identifying the task, the method is selected by default. In my opinion (also raised by Reviewer UqM4), it would improve readability if you specified that each task is currently assigned a default method, and future steps could include automatic method selection for a given detected task (out of this work's scope).

538,Let’s Think Dot by Dot: Hidden computation in transformer language models,Accept,V0ibqNViy0,,,,"[Reviewer_f5kZ]: Thanks for providing the rebuttal. 

Let me clarify my first point: I understand that 3-sum and 2-sum are TC0 problems, but I do not understand how the conclusions derived from experiments on these two problems can be generalized to the TC0 class in general. The authors seem to be drawing too strong a conclusion based on limited empirical evidence, which I suggest the authors clarify in the final version. 

Let me clarify my second point: I suggested that the models only learn meaningful representations for the filler tokens because the training data contains meaningful tokens (CoTs), so the models can assign a meaningful representation based on actual CoT semantics through positional relations. For example, if the model sees both ""the weather is good"" and ""the weather is ."", the last dot could be semantically related to ""weather."" Could you please clarify if this could be the case? If this happens, the overall contribution will be less interesting because the model relies more on positional embeddings and performs CoT implicitly in the filler-token settings. 

I am happy with the last point and willing to change my score if the previous question can be answered.

[Authors]: Thank you for this update on your questions!
1. We do not claim that 3SUM is representative of all of TC0 (more on this in comments [above](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NikbrdtYvG&noteId=YBOYaSGiZl)), but rather that 3SUM is representative of quantifier resolution problems having quantifier depth >2. Starting from our theoretically-motivated prediction that filler-tokens provide an expressive advantage for such quantifier resolution problems, we present filler-token success on 3SUM as empirical evidence (analogous to an existence proof) of the relevance of filler to problems of quantifier depth >2. These results do not suffice to show that all such quantifier resolution problems are solvable using filler; we will update language used in our paper to precisely reflect what our results show.
2. Regarding semantics, while we agree that the learned semantics of CoT in general are an important object to study, in our case (2SUM and 3SUM) the semantics are not a useful lens, since we are studying an algorithmic problem in which memorization/dataset-wide associations are irrelevant. In the algorithmic setting, the distinguishing feature between CoT and filler tokens is that CoT involves serial computation (increasing depth of circuit) while filler involves parallel computation (increasing width of circuit). On this view, the “parallelizable CoT solution” we train models on does, in principle, allow circuit reuse where the model executes similar activation patterns across both CoT and filler-token sequences. On the other hand, when training on “serial CoT solution” different circuits are required for CoT versus filler-token sequences. So indeed, we find that on 3SUM, models only succeed in learning to use filler tokens when the circuits learned on CoT match those needed for filler tokens, with the serial CoT-trained models failing to learn filler tokens. We agree that these results suggest filler-token use is limited since we expect most natural language CoT instances to involve serial computation. However, we see this as a contribution of our work rather than a drawback: to understand the broader prevalence of filler-token use, it is important to understand under what conditions filler-token use can be learned. Our results provide insight on this question showing that empirically, learning filler-token solutions is significantly harder in the absence of relevant, parallelizable CoT supervision for 3SUM.

[Reviewer_f5kZ]: Thanks for the answers, which are fair points to me. I suggest the authors verify all claims in the paper, make the language precise, and clarify the second point. With such promises, I increase the overall score."

Q.1 the necessity of the least squares method, and additional ablation studies, such as simply combining individual indicator functions to evaluate the quality of each instruction dataset

We use the least squares method to estimate parameters in multivariate functions due to its simplicity, explanatory power, and adaptability to various data types. Beyond the parameters detailed in the paper, the process of finding a usable function is also significant, allowing us to potentially replace the least squares method with other functions.

 --- 

Q.2 compare their method against some baselines
For, Alpagasus [1], However, It's expensive using chatgpt to give a score on large scale data. One of the advantages of the method proposed in our paper is that it is less costly.
We have the result of LIMA-7b model (LLaMA-2-7B finetuned with LIMA data) and results from [2]. Its OpenLLM benchmark scores are shown in the table below. 

|Model | Datasize | loss@self-instruct| loss@mt-bench| OpenLLM Avg| ARC| Hellaswag| MMLU|TruthfulQA|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|LIMA-7b|1000|0.9947|0.7604|0.5533|0.5563|0.8009|0.4371|0.419|
|InstructMining-7b|1000| 0.9576 | 0.7114 | 0.562525  | 0.5589 | 0.7877 | 0.4299 | 0.4736 |
|15% Alpaca-7b[2]| * | * | * | 0.5637 | 0.5742 | 0.8068 | 0.4640 | 0.4095 |

We also compared our model and LIMA model using LLM-as-a-judge. Results are listed in the table below

Q.1 Only LLAMA-based LLMs are evaluated. More models (e.g., Mistral ones) will be helpful to justify that the proposed method can generalize well for different LLMs.
 
Here are the ablation results on Falcon-7b based models.
| Model     | Data              | Loss@mt-bench | Loss@self-instruct |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Falcon-7B | Dolly-selected 1k | 1.1344        | 1.2780             |
| Falcon-7B | Dolly-random 1k   | 1.2396        | 1.3723             |
| Falcon-7B | Dolly-all         | 1.3028        | 1.3960             |


We also got results for the Mistral-7B models.

| Model      | Data              | Loss@mt-bench | Loss@self-instruct |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Mistral-7B | Dolly-selected 1k | 1.0528        | 1.2483             |
| Mistral-7B | Dolly-random 1k   | 1.1107        | 1.3365             |
| Mistral-7B | Dolly-all         | 1.1494        | 1.3824             |


We finetuned these models using the same selected 1000 dolly data, which we used in the paper to finetune LLaMA-2-7b. 

---

Q.2 a validation set loss/performance shall be adopted for the evaluation of the training data quality which is not very novel.

We conducted multiple experiments using various validation sets to learn the relationship between indicators and validation set loss. As a result, we derived a linear function that can be applied to each individual data sample for data selection. We were pioneers in applying this method to the instruction tuning task, not just using validation loss to evaluate data quality.

---

Q.3  Following this ""validation set loss"" idea, the double descent phenomenon is somewhat as expected?

We are the first to acknowledge the existence of the double descent phenomenon in instruction tuning.

---


Q.4 Breaking down the loss into a small set of pre-defined indicators following a linear combination seems overly simple?
Our proposed Instruction mining can incorporate other functional assumptions or methods to obtain the function. In our paper, we use the least squares method to derive linear functions, providing a clearer understanding of the resulting functions. The function type is just one aspect of our approach. We also demonstrate potential linear relationships between certain metrics and losses.

---

Q.5 applies an existing method BLENDSEARCH.

We are the first to utilize BLENDSEARCH for data selection in instruction tuning. BLENDSEARCH serves as the search solution in our method.


---

About the novelty in our paper.

Our paper is proposing a framework to do data selection in instruction tuning which could help improve the model performance. Our method is the first to combine these to do data selection on instruction tuning."

496,From Narratives to Numbers: Valid Inference Using Language Model Predictions from Verbal Autopsies,Accept,cvAvsB2YAU,,,,"[Reviewer_VDYf]: Thank you for the response. I agree with various elements of your rebuttal, and you touched on relevant aspects of my review. I should note that although a model-agnostic model _can_ run on older methods (and it is still good that you worked with them), this does not mean that you should _only_ (or mainly) focus on those older methods.

[Authors]: Thank you, this is a very good point. To add more information that is relevant for VA on modern LM techniques, we propose to add more discussion about the prompting. 

We will add the following discussion of our prompt engineering in our section 3.1.

“We faced a series of challenges in engineering this prompt, namely, coercing the LM to consistently return outputs constrained to our exact list of output classes [communicable, non-communicable, external, maternal, aids-tb]. Earlier iterations of the prompt yielded responses such as “The patient died due to external causes.” While perhaps semantically correct, validating outputs such as this at scale is intractable and would require additional steps (regex, fuzzy string matching, etc.). Instead, we found that including our desired output classes between html tags <options> </options> and explicitly asking the LM to return only a choice from the list of options in the prompt improved results considerably. Future work may include few shot prompting with select domain-specific examples or retrieval augmented generation from a larger database of narratives.”

To conclude this section we will add the following sentence. 

""We include outdated NLP approaches like the BoW representation classification models in our analysis because they are cheap and quick options, however we will focus our attention on interpreting the results from the GPT-4 modeling as it represents the current state of the art in language modeling and produces the most accurate results in this domain."""

If you give a precise account of changes proposed quoting text that will be added and where it will be added, this may allow me to raise the score further

[Authors]: Thank you for the suggestion, we will include these specific changes. 

In regards to the prompt engineering, we will include the following at the end of our section 3.1. 

“We faced a series of challenges in engineering this prompt, namely, coercing the LM to consistently return outputs constrained to our exact list of output classes [communicable, non-communicable, external, maternal, aids-tb].

Future work may include few shot prompting with select domain-specific examples or retrieval augmented generation from a larger database of narratives.”

Regarding class imbalance, we will add the following after the first sentence in our section 4.2 to expound on this point. 

“As evidenced by the COD distribution displayed in Figure 2, we are dealing with considerable class imbalance within and between sites. We address this in a sensitivity analysis (see Figures 29-54 in A.6) where we train each model on a stratified sample with an 80/20 split for each class to ensure an equal proportion of training examples for each class. The results from this analysis are not substantively different from our main results where we do not account for the class imbalance in our modeling. Alternative resampling methods such as SMOTE, ADASYN or Tomek Links could be applied to correct for the imbalanced distribution of COD. However, even in the absence of such considerations, we show that multiPPI++ still obtains valid estimates in downstream inference using predictions from imperfect NLP modeling. This extensibility of our approach is one of the advantages of the multiPPI++.”

Regarding our multiPPI++ performance, we will add this to our section 4.3 to give additional context in interpreting Figure 6.

""Figure 6 demonstrates that multiPPI++ improves the accuracy of statistical estimates using a post-facto correction term estimated using relatively small amounts of labeled data. As this is applied after model predictions are made, multiPPI++ does not improve or degrade model accuracy. This procedure provides a correction for the biased statistical inference parameters and the deflated uncertainty intervals around them, given NLP produced estimates of likely COD from VA narrative predictions. This is a nuanced yet important distinction as these downstream statistical inference parameters are what describe the relationship between covariates, such as age, and cause of death distributions. This same intuition extends to other domains where the end goal is to use inference to guide decision making where NLP predictions are used in place of ground truth labels."""

Please address them in the paper as well and try to clearly differentiate from the aforementioned related work. Also I revisited Das et al 2021 recently, and I am not sure that their experiment is in a static setting.

I have decided to keep my scores the same. Thank you.

[Authors]: In Das et. al 2021, the general methodology proposed in Section 2.2 (specifically in “Details of Input”) proposes their RAG solution in a static database setting. However, in Section 3.4.2, they motivate a HIL setup where they acquire example cases for unseen entities to improve upon the OOD test cases only. These examples are obtained from another dataset (SimpleQuestions) and users with knowledge about the KB. Their main motivation is to show that their method can improve performance without retraining by just expanding the database with relevant examples. We could not add these details in the main response due to the character limit. However note that their method and evaluation are still significantly different from ours:
* Our whole setup and evaluation assume a dynamic memory that grows from zero as new out-of-vocabulary constructs are seen and corrected with streams of test inferences to address the out-of-vocabulary scenario explicitly. This is unlike Das et. al 2021 who did an added HIL experiment to show that their idea can be expanded to dynamic memory. 
* Their HIL feedback requires writing whole train cases whereas ours requires the expert to add a small idiomatic description and the construct value as a lexicon. This is more efficient and effective in our use case, as shown in our results in Table 4(b).
* Das et. al 2021 generator incorporates a Kullback–Leibler loss function to reduce the difference between when cases are provided and when they are not. This loss, while suitable for their setting, is inappropriate for ours. This is because, in our case, we want the target formalism to explicitly use the open-vocabulary constructs defined in the lexicon feedback, even if it means that there is a significant deviation from baseline (models which do not use feedback). Hence, we formulate training schemes that teach the model to use feedback/knowledge more effectively (detailed in Section 4.2 of our paper).
* Das et. al 2021 also propose a revise step when modeling to specifically address the issue of domain mismatch when parsing NL to LF. They do this by aligning generated relations with relations present in the local neighborhood of the query entity in the KG, discovered via proximity between sentence embeddings. Hence, this modeling step is only suitable for their problem setting due to the nature of knowledge graphs. It is not ideal for our setting.

We thank the reviewer for pointing out the HIL setting, present in Section 3.4.2, in Das et. al 2021. We also thank them for engaging in this conversation which helped make our paper stronger.

[Authors]: Dear reviewer

We were wondering if you had a chance to look at the clarifications regarding Das et al. 2021. 

We believe our work shares similarities with the experiment in Das et al., 2021, but our work mainly focuses on OOV problem and addresses the important distinctions that arise in the problem settings we consider. As mentioned above we will add these discussions to the related work in the final version. We hope this addresses your concern in this regard.

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer ZNy2,

Since we are very close to the end of the discussion period, it is a gentle reminder that please engage with us for discussing our comments and newly added results. We worked very hard to generate 4 new figures of additional experiments. Let us know your thoughts and if you feel we have sufficiently addressed your concerns we invite you to improve your scores.

[Reviewer_ZNy2]: I acknowledge that I have read the author's rebuttal; however, I still stand for my original evaluation and thus will keep the score unchanged. My main concern is still how novel the proposed method is compared to the original LAWA (even with the updated result; the gain is pretty small) and also the application of the finding.

Based on your explanation, can we say that the plausible events given the current states must be seen in written corpora? If people haven't discovered the earth is round (and write them down in corpora), what will be the plausible event?

Sorry for my late reply!

If your bandwidth allows, I have following questions:

- Given there are many possibilities about the facts of the world, do you think your dataset have a good coverage about the next plausible event? For example, ""the earth is round"" is the case where there is only one plausible event. Will there be cases where multiple plausible events exist? What will be the coverage of your dataset on it? 
- Following the discussion on the multiple plausible events. What will be the distribution of the N (number of) multiple plausible events? Will it be a normal distribution?
- What properties should a model possess to perform well on your task of plausibility prediction? In another word, what are we actually modelling? Are we modelling knowledge and facts? Are we modelling a capacity for sequential prediction? 

I hope these questions can benefit your own understanding of the topic and help AC/colleague reviewers decide.

[Reviewer_K7jZ]: ## Final question (thread 3/N, N=3) ##

Hi Authors:

I have another question. Can you help us differentiate your work against conditional QA/NLI or situated QA/NLI. For example, this paper [1] appears to adopt a pretty similar formalisation as you do in your paper (e.g. Figure 1 in this paper). 

Following the example of ""earth is round"", can we say your work can be seen as considering the truthfulness of a proposition conditioned on one additional fact (e.g. ""ship will return to the same point after sailing for months""). 

If above is true, the questions are (1) how would you differentiate your work against previous conditional / situated QA/NLI studies? (2) Do you think inferring such hidden / additional facts is the crux for solving your task? What can we expect from a model if it can perform very well on your task?

[Authors]: Thanks again for your review and additional questions

Q: Based on your explanation, can we say that the plausible events given the current states must be seen in written corpora? If people haven't discovered the earth is round (and write them down in corpora), what will be the plausible event?

A: No it doesn’t need to be written in corpora to be a plausible event. And such a plausible event, the earth is round, although not discovered, should be possible to infer from other knowledge such as natural phenomena that cannot be explained if the earth is not round. And better LLMs should be better able to handle this.

[Authors]: Q: Given there are many possibilities about the facts of the world, do you think your dataset have a good coverage about the next plausible event? For example, ""the earth is round"" is the case where there is only one plausible event. Will there be cases where multiple plausible events exist? What will be the coverage of your dataset on it? 

A: Yes there will be cases where there are multiple plausible events. Take the Brazilian footballer Marcelo again, it is plausible that he is Spanish (he actually is, but not in training data) due to the fact he played in Spain for a number of years and the immigration policy and let’s say it is also plausible that he is Portuguese because his parents are Portuguese. In this case, our dataset would also place Portuguese near the top of the rankings because there are many Brazilians that are also Portugueses, thus the co-occurrences between these two nationalities must be frequent. Yet you are right we only evaluated the most plausible event (in this case it would be Spanish) and ignored the second plausible event (Portuguese). Extending our evaluation to multiple plausible events would be a promising future direction.

Q: Following the discussion on the multiple plausible events. What will be the distribution of the N (number of) multiple plausible events? Will it be a normal distribution?

A: It depends on the relation, if the relation is mutually exclusive (such as place of death), then the distribution is more concentrated whereas other relations (such as place visited) can have many plausible events. Therefore the distribution should be different from relation to relation.

Q:What properties should a model possess to perform well on your task of plausibility prediction? In another word, what are we actually modelling? Are we modelling knowledge and facts? Are we modelling a capacity for sequential prediction?

A: PRobELM is trying to capture the unknown/unrecorded/unthought events (not known facts at the time) that can be inferred from current world knowledge, especially in the context of knowledge discovery. PRobELM is not about forecasting the future sequential events, which would be uncertain (not guaranteed to happen).

[Authors]: Q: Can you help us differentiate your work against conditional QA/NLI or situated QA/NLI. For example, this paper [1] appears to adopt a pretty similar formalisation as you do in your paper (e.g. Figure 1 in this paper).

A: There are at least two differences we can think of between ProbELM and SituatedQA: 1) SituatedQA is about known facts, e.g. in the example of Figure 1 in the paper all of the answers are factual, just at different points in time/geographical space. However, something can be plausible but not yet known as a fact, and this is the focus of ProbELM. 2) The (factual) answers to the SituatedQA change over time, but this is not the case in ProbELM; the shape of the earth will not change, but it is not known at the time.

Q: Following the example of ""earth is round"", can we say your work can be seen as considering the truthfulness of a proposition conditioned on one additional fact (e.g. ""ship will return to the same point after sailing for months"").

A: It can happen like this, but It would not always be the case. If someone did this experiment and the ship did not return to the same point (due to wind or any other reason), the earth being round would remain a plausible hypothesis.

Q: If above is true, the questions are (1) how would you differentiate your work against previous conditional / situated QA/NLI studies? (2) Do you think inferring such hidden / additional facts is the crux for solving your task? What can we expect from a model if it can perform very well on your task?

A: As said, the above is not always true. Having said this, a good model would perform well in our task if it is able to synthesize its knowledge in a plausible manner. As stated in the example in figure 1 of our paper, the evidence about the footballer Marcelo, if combined correctly, should make the Spanish nationality more plausible than Irish.

[Reviewer_K7jZ]: Hi authors:

Thank you for your fast responses. I am sympathetic with you about your arguments about your work is about known VS unknown (in the parametric knowledge of a LM). I believe this is one key difference against prior works. I am raising my scores to 7 given such arguments. 

I still have reservations about the modelling part. Current approach is black box and it does not tell what is a LM actually modelling.  As you wrote, and I agree, that the skills is to synthesise its knowledge in a plausible manner. I believe it should be defined in a formal way -- what knowledge and in which manner (e.g. deductive or inductive reasoning?).

474,PRobELM: Plausibility Ranking Evaluation for Language Models,Accept,XGymuX9Umg,,,,"[Reviewer_PJpF]: Thank you for the explanation. I get most of the rebuttal ideas. For the ""Ground Truth Ranking"" concern, I would expect a more thorough analysis to be presented in the later version of the paper.

Another concern I have for this paper is that this paper is built for each LM and uses the corresponding cutoff time to generate the data. How do you expect this benchmark to be long-lasting for future research and development on LM?

If this additional concern can be answered, I'll further raise my evaluation.

[Authors]: Ground Truth Ranking:

We will report more detailed statistics in the next version.

Future LLMs:

Benchmark is built for each LLM: Your concern is reasonable, however our benchmark can be reused as long as the training data of the LLM is not more recent than the evaluation time stamps of the benchmark. See in Table 1, that OLMO and LLama are evaluated on the same version of the benchmark, since the timestamps considered are more recent than the training data. Furthermore, we can always remove evaluation scenarios as more recent training data is used. Finally, the benchmark construction process is fully automated, so even if we needed to create new scenarios for later timestamps than the ones we considered in this version, it would only require running our code on more recent versions of wikidata.

[Reviewer_PJpF]: Hi Authors,

Thank you for your explanation. However, from the paper, especially Section 3.3, I don't see the dataset creation is fully automated. Can you elaborate more about this?

Thank you.

[Authors]: Thanks again for your review and additional question.

Sorry for the confusion. In the response we meant that: using our 71 relations, extending our dataset to a future version of Wikidata for future models is fully automated, as the quality control (sec 3.3) is relation specific not timestamp specific. Given that we have done the quality control, the rest of the data construction is fully automated therefore extending is also fully automated."

Thank you for your fast responses. I am sympathetic with you about your arguments about your work is about known VS unknown (in the parametric knowledge of a LM). I believe this is one key difference against prior works. I am raising my scores to 7 given such arguments. 

I still have reservations about the modelling part. Current approach is black box and it does not tell what is a LM actually modelling.  As you wrote, and I agree, that the skills is to synthesise its knowledge in a plausible manner. I believe it should be defined in a formal way -- what knowledge and in which manner (e.g. deductive or inductive reasoning?). 

Best, K7jZ"

[Reviewer_6qVT]: I would like to thank the authors for taking the time to prepare a rebuttal and to reply to the questions raised.

I do not think the authors' rebuttal refutes the concerns I raised, such as lack of guarantees and lack of comparison to other methods (a concern also raised by other reviewers). However, I do see the point about LLMs and planning and the connection is solid there, in my opinion.

Overall, I think the novelty of this approach and its likely interest to the community outweigh the limitations. Given the novelty, it would be understandably hard to fit every required ablation and experiment into a single paper. I am comfortable raising my score to a 7 subject to a commitment by the authors to expand the (currently very short) limitations section to include an acknowledgment of the lack of guarantees provided by Searchformer, and a mention that in this respect it is inferior to out of the box A*. Where Searchformer outperforms classical planning methods is in other areas, so this limitation is just fine given what we know about how Transformers and neural methods work generally.

Please also revise the introduction and future work sections as you mentioned.

If the authors would please leave a comment committing to the expansion of the limitations section along the lines outlined above, I will officially raise my score to a 7.

3. The MMLU comment has reason: Often when models become better, their PPL on wrong and right answers go low together.

[Reviewer_vEjv]: Thank you for your response! I disagree with the decision to remove the histograms entirely. Imo the zoomed in version is fine and informative, as long as you are clear about the differing x-scales.

I appreciate the discussion of sensitivity to k. However, it is not immediately obvious to me why it would be preferable to tune the KDE bandwidth than the k. ""There always exists some $\delta$ such that the change in density at query point $q$ for bandwidth $h$ versus bandwidth $h+\delta$ is bounded and small"" -- is it also true that it is easy to find such delta? Are optimal values for one hyperparameter expected to hold more stable in across settings?

Also, fwiw I agree with reviewer y6ai's assessment that it would be extremely informative to see isolated Paras=3 in Figure 2, given that 1, 2, and 3 are sorted in ""ascending order by similarity."" I would appreciate some sort of verbal commitment to running this ablation before camera ready.

I am willing to slightly increase my rating, but I believe there is room for improvement before publication (Edit: increased rating from 4->5)

[Authors]: Thank you for the response and the increased rating!

Regarding the histograms in Figure 3, we're glad that you think the zoomed in version is informative. If there is no conflicting request from the other reviewers, then we can certainly include a final version of Figure 3 that swaps in the zoomed in histograms for the paraphrase only cases, and add a clear description of the axes scaling for that row in the caption.

Regarding the KDE bandwidth $h$ versus the value of $k$, we'd like to clarify that the rebuttal comment about the ""$h+\delta$"" is not about actually finding such a $\delta$, but rather a comment about the _smoothness_ of density wrt the users choice of $h$, versus the lack of smoothness of top-k wrt the users choice of $k$ (imagine one chose $h$ to be slightly off from ""optimal"" versus $k$ that is off by 1 or more). 

That said, we'd like to step back and remark that this is actually a classic choice in general for nearest neighbor data structures. Thinking simply of the nearest neighbor search process abstractly, one can either retrieve the ""nearest k points"" in the space, or can retrieve the ""points that are closer than some radius d"". A KDE measure with some bandwidth $h$ is actually a relaxation of the latter, as it is effectively building evidence at a query point based on a _soft_ analogue to a radius. 

Relevant to this conversation, we also think that the analysis presented in the recent response to y6ai is quite informative here. We find that since the KDE and the top-k measure seem to account for _different_ aspects of the variance in our setting, that there exists complementarity between the KDE and the top-k measures. Using the extra page of space, we think a concise presentation of this analysis and a discussion of complementarity of the two apporaches would make a good addition towards the end of the camera ready main body.

Finally, in light of the discussion with y6ai and your most recent comments, between now and camera ready, we are happy to agree to run the requested training experiment with just the singular nearest paraphrase (para 3), and analyze it in the same manner as the other settings. This would mean visualizing it with the other settings within Fig. 2, and in Fig. 3."

[Authors]: Thank you for your continued engagement in the review process!

First, we would like to remark on the close relationship between duplication and density, as it seems to be a relevant distinction to discuss. In the review copy (Section 2.1 sentence 2) we note that ""Repetition is an important extremal case of elevated density corresponding to a spike in the density function at a specific point in the sample space"" and as such we expected duplication to have a strong effect. By design, we included it in our controlled experiments. We also agree that it is relevant to our in the wild experiments. However, we would like to underscore the fact that the presence or lack thereof of duplicates, which are expected to affect both density measures and top-k distance measures, does not invalidate any particular experiment. It also would not invalidate any particular claim about density as duplication _is_ an instance of increased density, albeit an extreme one. 

Additionally, regarding para=3, we chose to include paras=1, paras=12, and paras=123 in order to make the results cleaner and easier to understand. The cumulative relationship between the chosen paraphrase settings means that density would be expected to grow across those three levels of leakage in an easy to interpret manner.

Next, in light of recent comments 1. and 2. the authors took a step back and considered an alternate modeling setup, one where we directly ask ""can the two features, density and top-k distance, can explain _different_ aspects of variance?"" We realized that this could be achieved by running an particular regression model that asks whether the two features explain significant parts of the variance in the performance outcome, when controlling for the variance explainable by the other.

```
loss_rank_acc ~ gaussian_0.1 + avg_10_neighbor_distance + (1 | query_length) + (1 | task/idx)
```

Our predictors (""Fixed effects"") are `gaussian_0.1` and `avg_10_neighbor_distance` and target is `loss_rank_acc`. The other features of `query_length` and the subtask id from the MMLU subject list and the particular question id (i.e. `task/idx`) are treated as ""Random effects"" that the model attempts to marginalize out.

```
Fixed effects:
                           Estimate Std. Error  z value Pr(>|z|)    
(Intercept)               1.416e+00  3.514e-01    4.029 5.60e-05 ***
gaussian_0.1              4.625e+04  5.372e+00 8609.363  < 2e-16 ***
avg_10_neighbor_distance -3.595e-01  8.711e-02   -4.127 3.68e-05 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
```

We want to look at the `Estimate` of the coefficient, and the `Pr(>|z|)` or p-value representing the significance of the predictive relationship for each feature. Interpreting the coefficients, we observe that as density goes up, rank accuracy goes up ($+$ coef) and as neighbor distance goes up rank accuracy goes down ($-$ coef) as expected. Next, moving to the p-values, the model suggests these relationships are accounting for _unique variance_, i.e., the small p-values indicate that both terms remain reliable predictors of variance when included in the same model (*** level or better).

This evidence clearly shows that despite the intuitive and theoretical ways in which top-k distances and the kernel density measure are related, in practice, they can each be used to explain different parts of model behavior. We agree with the reviewer that studying this relationship further is an important area for future work. Overall, we are very thankful to the reviewer for prompting us to undertake this analysis! We will perform a more complete set of similar regressions for the camera ready copy that helps the work more clearly communincate the difference between our proposed methodology and the top-k distance baseline.

Finally, regarding 3. we agree that the relationship between multiple choice task performance and the likelihoods assigned to individual responses is complicated. That said, the experiment that the reviewer proposes has roughly two outcomes. Either, the same trend in PPL on the correct answer as a function of density or neighbor distance is observed when computing PPL on incorrect answers, or it is not/the trend is different. This experiment would not really build any extra evidence about the overall hypothesis regarding performance and training density. In particular, finding that a trend or significant predictive relationship exists in both evaluation setups (MMLU+correct answer and MMLU+incorrect answer), would actually only suggest to you that PPL is probably a weak proxy for discontinuous evaluations like MCQ accuracy. However, this is a known result in the literature, and the models we had access to are too weak to solve MMLU well in the first place. When it was possible to do so, in our controlled experiments, we focused on the more meaningful task accuracy measure rather than PPL."

>Reviewer ts3J: ""The authors' response addresses my first reject reason, which is appreciated. However, after carefully checking the code, I maintain my reservation regarding the heavy reliance on GLIGEN and ModelScopeT2V, which dominates the described method.”


To begin with, we would like to re-state that in addition to the first rejection reason, the third and the fourth rejection reason were already covered in our first rebuttal response.
We respectfully disagree with the assertion that our primary contribution relies heavily on GLIGEN and ModelScopeT2V. As we mentioned in the rebuttal, our paper contribution consists of three parts: (1) LLM for video plan generation, (2) Layout-guided video generation with consistency control, as well as (3) Novel evaluation metrics and datasets for measuring layout and consistency accuracy for (multi-scene) video generation, as detailed below:

(1) Firstly, we would like to emphasize that a substantial part of our work focuses on introducing the use of LLMs to generate complex, useful plans for multi-scene video generation. We start from the motivation/observation that LLMs (GPT-4) can generate bounding box movements with physical world understanding (Fig. 12), then design a multi-component video plan (Sec. 3.1) via in-context learning (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8). Finally, we conducted thorough analysis of the effect of different LLMs (Table 9), different layout control methods (Table 11), as well as error analysis (Table 8). We believe our paper has covered the analysis of LLMs in a relatively complete way. If you have any other questions or concerns, we are more than willing for open discussion.

(2) Secondly, we would like to highlight that our method is agnostic to the backbone model. To make our pipeline work, we need to build on one specific video generation model (e.g., ModelScopeT2V, the best open-source T2V model at the time). However, it's easy to adapt our framework to future video generation backbones. In addition, adopting a gated self-attention module from GLIGEN is only one part of our architecture design. We also made a non-trivial effort to enhance it with text+image embedding conditioning, proposed sharable embedding for multi-scene consistency control, and creatively trained the video generation module in a parameter-efficient way with only images (Sec. 3.2). We also did extensive ablation studies of our model architecture design (Table 4, 7, 10, 12). Therefore, stating that our method ""relies heavily on GLIGEN and ModelScopeT2V'' is not well-supported. 

(3) Thirdly, we provide comprehensive qualitative + quantitative experiments including novel evaluation metrics (movement direction accuracy / entity consistency) / new datasets (ActionBench-Direction/Coref-SV) for video generation, which could be beneficial for future works on layout-guided and multi-scene video generation.

----------------------------

**Part2 response to updated reviewer comment:**

>Reviewer ts3J: “Moreover, the emphasis on video rather than LM suggests that this work falls short of the expectations set by the CoLM standards.""

**We strongly believe that our novel framework leveraging LMs for video generation aligns well with CoLM’s interests.** Specifically, our work addresses the topic of “17. LMs on diverse modalities and novel applications,” as outlined in the CoLM call for papers (https://colmweb.org/cfp.html). 

```17. LMs on diverse modalities and novel applications: visual LMs, code LMs, math LMs, and so forth, with extra encouragement for less studied modalities or applications such as chemistry, medicine, education, database, and beyond.```

Moreover, the CoLM homepage (https://colmweb.org/index.html) mentions:

```CoLM is an academic venue focused on the study of language modeling, broadly defined, with the goal of creating a community of researchers with expertise in different disciplines, focused on understanding, improving, and critiquing the development of LM technology.```

**These underline the relevance of our contribution to the CoLM community.** 
**We kindly ask for a reconsideration of the review and rating in light of these points.**"

- Thanks, we would like to bring your attention to our previous response to W1 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=sKNIjS2brr&noteId=UaqWRftSIi), we have shown the comparison between LLaMA2, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4 in Table 9 of Section H.1. 

- From the result in Table 9, we can see that fine-tuned LLaMA2-13B performs in-between GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 (GPT-3.5-turbo 49.0 v.s. LLaMA2-13B 53.3 v.s. GPT-4 59.8).


>I'm curious what is the random accuracy in ActionBench-directions? 

- As described in the paragraph “ActionBench-Direction prompts” on page 20 of our paper, for each object, we give prompts that include four movement directions: ‘left to right’, ‘right to left’, ‘top to bottom’, and ‘bottom to top’. Therefore, for a random guess, the movement accuracy on the ActionBench-directions dataset should be around 25%. 


We hope our clarification is helpful. Please let us know if any part of our response is still unclear to you. Thanks!

[Reviewer_HYoe]: Thanks for the answer."

[Authors]: **Part1 response to updated reviewer comment:**
>Reviewer ts3J: ""The authors' response addresses my first reject reason, which is appreciated. However, after carefully checking the code, I maintain my reservation regarding the heavy reliance on GLIGEN and ModelScopeT2V, which dominates the described method.”


To begin with, we would like to re-state that in addition to the first rejection reason, the third and the fourth rejection reason were already covered in our first rebuttal response.
We respectfully disagree with the assertion that our primary contribution relies heavily on GLIGEN and ModelScopeT2V. As we mentioned in the rebuttal, our paper contribution consists of three parts: (1) LLM for video plan generation, (2) Layout-guided video generation with consistency control, as well as (3) Novel evaluation metrics and datasets for measuring layout and consistency accuracy for (multi-scene) video generation, as detailed below:

(1) Firstly, we would like to emphasize that a substantial part of our work focuses on introducing the use of LLMs to generate complex, useful plans for multi-scene video generation. We start from the motivation/observation that LLMs (GPT-4) can generate bounding box movements with physical world understanding (Fig. 12), then design a multi-component video plan (Sec. 3.1) via in-context learning (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8). Finally, we conducted thorough analysis of the effect of different LLMs (Table 9), different layout control methods (Table 11), as well as error analysis (Table 8). We believe our paper has covered the analysis of LLMs in a relatively complete way. If you have any other questions or concerns, we are more than willing for open discussion.

(2) Secondly, we would like to highlight that our method is agnostic to the backbone model. To make our pipeline work, we need to build on one specific video generation model (e.g., ModelScopeT2V, the best open-source T2V model at the time). However, it's easy to adapt our framework to future video generation backbones. In addition, adopting a gated self-attention module from GLIGEN is only one part of our architecture design. We also made a non-trivial effort to enhance it with text+image embedding conditioning, proposed sharable embedding for multi-scene consistency control, and creatively trained the video generation module in a parameter-efficient way with only images (Sec. 3.2). We also did extensive ablation studies of our model architecture design (Table 4, 7, 10, 12). Therefore, stating that our method ""relies heavily on GLIGEN and ModelScopeT2V'' is not well-supported. 

(3) Thirdly, we provide comprehensive qualitative + quantitative experiments including novel evaluation metrics (movement direction accuracy / entity consistency) / new datasets (ActionBench-Direction/Coref-SV) for video generation, which could be beneficial for future works on layout-guided and multi-scene video generation.

----------------------------

**Part2 response to updated reviewer comment:**

>Reviewer ts3J: “Moreover, the emphasis on video rather than LM suggests that this work falls short of the expectations set by the CoLM standards.""

**We strongly believe that our novel framework leveraging LMs for video generation aligns well with CoLM’s interests.** Specifically, our work addresses the topic of “17. LMs on diverse modalities and novel applications,” as outlined in the CoLM call for papers (https://colmweb.org/cfp.html). 

```17. LMs on diverse modalities and novel applications: visual LMs, code LMs, math LMs, and so forth, with extra encouragement for less studied modalities or applications such as chemistry, medicine, education, database, and beyond.```

Moreover, the CoLM homepage (https://colmweb.org/index.html) mentions:

```CoLM is an academic venue focused on the study of language modeling, broadly defined, with the goal of creating a community of researchers with expertise in different disciplines, focused on understanding, improving, and critiquing the development of LM technology.```

**These underline the relevance of our contribution to the CoLM community.** 
**We kindly ask for a reconsideration of the review and rating in light of these points.**

[Reviewer_ts3J]: After carefully reviewing the authors' response and considering other reviewers' comments, I have decided to maintain my rating at [4. rejection] for the following reasons:

1. **Heavy reliance on GLIGEN and ModelScopeT2V:** Despite the authors' claims of significant contributions, the code indicates a primary dependence on these existing models or methods.
2. **Poor organization:** Many important evaluation and ablation studies are relegated to the supplementary materials, which undermines the persuasiveness of the main sections. Given that supplementary materials will not be published, this is a significant issue.
3. **Misalignment with conference scope:** As a work focused on video generation, it is not well-suited for a language modeling (LM) conference. Although the authors reference many CoLM criteria, visual LMs are different from diffusion model technologies. This paper primarily centers on video generation with diffusion models rather than LMs. It may be more appropriate for the authors to reorganize their work and submit it to a vision-focused conference.

[Authors]: >1. Heavy reliance on GLIGEN and ModelScopeT2V: Despite the authors' claims of significant contributions, the code indicates a primary dependence on these existing models or methods.

- As we already clearly elaborated in our previous responses, our method is agnostic to the backbone model. To make our pipeline work for the purpose of experimentation, we need to choose one specific video generation model to build upon (e.g., ModelScopeT2V, the best open-source T2V model at the time), and it's easy to adapt our framework to future video generation backbones. 
As an analogy, LLM researchers usually build their methods on top of existing language models (e.g., Llama), which also indicates a primary dependence on these models. Thus, we believe it’s unfair to criticize a paper due to the foundation model it uses.



>2. Poor organization: Many important evaluation and ablation studies are relegated to the supplementary materials, which undermines the persuasiveness of the main sections. Given that supplementary materials will not be published, this is a significant issue.

- Firstly, our paper contains thorough analysis of how to use LLMs to help video generation, so we put the most important results in the main paper, and relatively less important ablation studies in the appendix (similar to all other papers submitted to COLM and all other conferences with 8-10 page limits). If the reviewer believes that it’s worthwhile to bring some ablation studies from the appendix back to the main paper, we are very willing to use the extra page given in the camera-ready version for this purpose.

- Secondly, **we have emailed COLM PCs last night, and they told us to share the clear confirmation that the supplementary material will be made public along with the paper.** 

Considering all these aspects, we strongly believe that this should not be a “significant issue”. 


>3. Misalignment with conference scope: As a work focused on video generation, it is not well-suited for a language modeling (LM) conference. Although the authors reference many CoLM criteria, visual LMs are different from diffusion model technologies. This paper primarily centers on video generation with diffusion models rather than LMs. It may be more appropriate for the authors to reorganize their work and submit it to a vision-focused conference.


- As we already mentioned in our previous responses, our focus is on how to use LLMs to help the video generation task. Using visual LMs could be one technical design choice, and using LLMs+diffusion could be another design choice. We chose our approach because diffusion models are the most popular framework for modern image/video generation currently. Given that both methods are under the topic of using LLMs to help video generation, we strongly believe that the specific technical design choices to tackle this problem should not be the key point to distinguish if a paper should be incorporated into COLM."

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for their time and effort in reviewing our paper. 

We hope that our response has addressed all the questions and hope that the reviewer can consider revising the score based on our response. We are also happy to discuss any additional questions.

With sincere regards,

The authors

[Reviewer_Ycer]: I would like to thank the authors for providing additional qualitative and quantitative results. After reviewing the authors' rebuttal and other reviewers' comments, I am keeping my original score. 

I have a similar concern with reviewer ts3J about the novelty and technical contribution of the paper. The proposed model is built on top of the off-the-shelf T2V generation model ModelScopeT2V, and the technical contribution is thus limited. Increasing the number of human annotators from 5 to 10 is useful. However, in my opinion, it is still too small a sample size to be reliable.

[Authors]: Thanks for your questions. We provide response and clarification as below:

>1. The proposed model is built on top of the off-the-shelf T2V generation model ModelScopeT2V, and the technical contribution is thus limited. 

- We would like to respectfully disagree with the statement that building on top of T2V generation foundation models could lead to the claim that technical contribution is limited. As an analogy, many LLM researchers usually build their methods on top of existing language models (e.g., Llama) instead of training such foundation models from scratch. Similarly, the training cost of T2V generation models like ModelScopeT2V is too high to be affordable for most of the researchers. In addition, our method is model agnostic/easy to adapt to other video generation backbones. Therefore, we kindly request the reviewer to reconsider this statement. 


>2. Increasing the number of human evaluators from 5 to 10 is useful. However, in my opinion, it is still too small a sample size to be reliable.

- We would like to bring to the reviewer’s attention that using less than 10 or around 10 human evaluators is very common in related works in NLP [1], multi-modal AI [2], diffusion models [3], and LLM+diffusion works [4, 5], and these papers are well received at top conferences and journals such as EMNLP, ICLR, ICCV, and TMLR. These works include ControlNet [3], which won the best paper award in ICCV 2023, and MaRVL [2], the best paper in EMNLP 2021.


We hope our clarification is helpful. Please let us know if you have any other questions. Thanks!

[Authors]: Thank you for your response! 

Firstly in case you haven’t seen the overall review response message (we weren't able to include the following in the response to your review due to character limit, but included it in the response for reviewer oNbF):  

---
We would like to thank reviewers for their effort and constructive feedback! We are encouraged that XpW4 and oNbF acknowledge our contribution and find our experiments comprehensive and convincing.

Given this paper is in the **LMs and interactions track**, we aim to tackle the pressing problem of human verification of LLM generations. We developed **SymGen to make it easier for users’ to verify an LLM’s generation** and evaluate its performance via multiple human studies. To thoroughly understand how SymGen works on different tasks, we also experiment to ensure **SymGen’s generation quality is on par with the baseline** on multiple tasks, and we do not intend to claim that SymGen can improve generations (e.g., better reasoning or grounded generation).

---

Thank you for the detailed questions clarifying the results and model choices. We will implement the following changes to clarify these details in our paper: 
- Describe the parsing pipeline in depth and mention the opportunities for using other formats (e.g., yaml). 
- Clarify why we use specific strategy is adopted in experiments in table 1 and 2, and additional description and examples for the Rotowire and Synthbio dataset. 
- Clarify the point ""In the related work section authors talk about LLM-based verification methods, without justifying the differences or why comparisons cannot be made."": While data-to-text generation is well-established, to the best of our knowledge we are the first to focus on how the generation can be made easier to verify by users.

The proposed changes are mostly clarifying experimental details–which can be easily incorporated in this version without major alterations to the text. Most importantly, we don't see this as changing the main claim of our paper: that SymGen can make generations easily verifiable by humans. For this reason, we kindly ask you to reconsider increasing your score and please let us know if you find additional changes are necessary. Thanks!"

442,Fakes of Varying Shades: How Warning Affects Human Perception and Engagement Regarding LLM Hallucinations,Accept,IwK5CgmUg2,,,,"[Authors]: Per COLM’s approval for additional comments during the discussion phase, below, we provide further details to some of the questions you asked. Thank you for the detailed review. We are sorry for the brevity and formatting issues in the rebuttal, owing to the 2500 characters limit. We address your concerns 3, 4, 6-8 here and will include the explanations in our revision.

3.Here, F=F-statistic, p=p-value, and η^2_p=eta-squared, noting effect size: reported from mixed analysis of variances (ANOVAs) test using SPSS. We explain the rationale behind using mixed ANOVA in response 10: ""we used mixed ANOVA following prior work [12,13], a standard statistical technique given our study design with one between-subjects factor (warn vs. con) and one within-subjects factor (genuine vs. minor vs. major hallucination), both of which are categorical variables.""

4.These are the perceived accuracies for each condition. We provide the rationale in response 5: “perceived accuracy is a widely accepted metric in misinformation literature[12-15]. Participants were asked ""How accurate do you think the answer is?” and they rated the accuracy on a 5-point scale, e.g., “CON: genuine: 3.978, minor: 3.287, major: 2.563” indicates that participants in the control condition rated genuine contents as more accurate compared to minor and major hallucination, as the perceived accuracy for genuine contents (3.978) is greater than those for minor (3.287) and major (2.563) hallucinations.

6.These are the post-hoc test results for minor hallucination, major hallucination, and genuine contents, respectively, conducted using Bonferroni correction in SPSS (F=F-statistic, p=p-value, η2p=effect size). “Minor: F(1,419) = 5.011, p = .026, η2p = 0.012” indicates participants in WARN condition were better at detecting minor hallucination than CON (F-statistic=5.011, statistically significant with p < .05) with small effect size(effect size: 0.01[small]<n2p<0.06, [medium]). 

7.Owing to a scarcity of space, we presented the results of the correlation analysis in detail in the appendix (A.3.2, Table 4) and discussed the highlights in the results section. Table 4 is explained in detail in the following response.

8.Table 4 shows the pairwise correlations between user engagement measures (e.g., dislike and share) and the pairwise correlations between user engagement measures and perceived accuracy (e.g., perceived accuracy and dislike). We use Spearman’s correlation coefficients (r_s) to measure correlation and explain the rationale in response 10: “as we were interested in whether the variables were monotonically related”, even if the relationship is nonlinear. We also use the z-test for pairwise comparisons between correlation coefficients, to examine if the differences in coefficients were statistically significant. 

For instance, Row 6 in Table 4 indicates the correlations between perceived accuracy and dislike. For ease of explanation, we copy only Rows 1 and 6 alongside the table caption from the paper.

| Correlation                 | Genuine   | Minor     | Major     | CON       | WARN      | Significant pairwise Comparisons |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Perceived accuracy, Dislike | -0.457*** | -0.650*** | -0.685*** | -0.664*** | -0.590*** | gn-mi***, gn-mj***               |		 	 

Table 4: The pairwise correlations for (1) different user engagement measures and (2) perceived accuracy and user engagement measures. The correlations are Spearman’s correlation coefficients (r_s), where (***: p_s < 0.001, **: p_s < 0.01, *: p_s < 0.05). The significant pairwise comparisons are obtained using z-test (***: p < 0.001, **: p < 0.01, *: p < 0.05).

Examining the correlations between perceived accuracy and dislike for each within-subjects (genuine, minor, major) and between-subjects condition (WARN, CON), we observe that all column values are negative and highly statistically significant (*** indicates that the p-value for r_s, p_s < .001), i.e., when perceived accuracy increases, dislike decreases, indicating that participants are less likely to dislike a content if they perceive it as accurate, across content types and warning conditions.

In addition, there are two significant pairwise comparisons (genuine-minor and genuine-major) with high statistical significance (*** indicates that p-value for z-test, p < .001), as the correlation between perceived accuracy and dislike for genuine contents (-0.457) is less negative compared to minor (-0.650) and major (-0.685). These results suggest greater cohesion between perceived accuracy and dislike for minor and major hallucinations compared to genuine contents.

[Authors]: Since the term hallucination is fundamental for our study and as we authors and the reviewer seem to disagree on its precise definition, we reiterate and provide more details on our use of the term hallucination here. Using the reference [1–8] that the reviewer provided and [9-11] that we further identified, here is our analysis:

* IDENTICAL definition: [1,3,7, 9-11] define hallucination as generated content that is nonsensical or unverifiable, without noting intrinsic limitations. This is the identical definition as ours. 

* Non-Identical or Non-Conflicting definition: Relevant works where the definition of hallucination (1) does not match with ours but also does not conflict [2, 4, 8] or (2) does not match [5] also cite hallucination benchmark datasets [9, 11] that manually inject non-factual information or use fake news as prompts. Consequently, we argue that our use of the term “hallucination” is acceptable.

Below, please find the definitions of hallucinations from the cited literature. 
* IDENTICAL definition

[2] cites HaluEval [9], where hallucination is generated by manually injecting incorrect information through prompt engineering and [11] where hallucination is generated using incorrect data such as fake news from Politifact.

[4] also cites HaluEval [9] as a hallucination benchmark.

There are many other public models like Mistral, LLama etc.   They may produce a completely different level of hallucinations and while the direction of results may remain the same the exact extent of impact may be more interesting to learn. Further, many cross-analysts on using different LLMs might also be impactful to see fakes of actual 'varying shades' from different LLMs. In the current format, the authors are missing a great opportunity for an impactful study.

[Authors]: Thank you so much for your feedback. Please note that we are NOT disagreeing on the point that exploring variations of hallucinations across different LLMs is indeed an important research question and could have strengthened our findings even further. However, please understand that there are many dimensions of interesting research questions that we could have looked into. For instance, in the beginning of our study design, we have identified the following dimensions of research questions:  different degrees of hallucinations, effect of priming techniques, whether/how participants are trained, effect of LLMs or their sizes/architectures on hallucination evaluation, etc.. We believe that each dimension could lead to an interesting research design and important findings. Owing to our current time and resource constraints, strategically, we had to prioritize certain dimensions for this study, and we decided to focus on two dimensions first:  investigating the differences in perception and engagement regarding (1) different types of hallucinations and (2) the influence of warnings. We acknowledge that our decision of focus prevents our findings to be generalizable across different LLMs. We plan to investigate other dimensions as future work, including variations of LLMs and their features."

> We measured user engagement to gauge the likelihood of the reinforcement of (via like) and spread of (via share) AI-generated falsehoods.

The motivation makes sense to me, but it is unclear to what degree a participant's behavior in the artificial context of the study would resemble or deviate from their behavior on social media, where there are real social stakes. Adding some discussion of this could benefit the paper, potentially including the details of how much time your users spent on the study. This could also appear in a limitations section.

> We will add the hallucination generation prompt to the appendix, shown in our response to Reviewer QkWo below.

Thank you. This addresses my third limitation from the original review.

> All genuine and hallucinated texts were generated by GPT-3.5-Turbo. If genuine texts were human-written, paraphrasing them with the LLM could be useful. However, in our case, as the genuine and hallucinated texts all have the same source, it could introduce redundancy and complicate the design.

This addresses concern #2, which was based on a misunderstanding. Given that genuine text is already model-generated, I agree it would be redundant to add a summarization condition.

Given the authors' response, I have raised my score. I encourage the authors to add discussion relevant to point #1 in revisions.

[Authors]: Thank you so much! We will add the discussions relevant to point #1 in our revision."

> We measured user engagement to gauge the likelihood of the reinforcement of (via like) and spread of (via share) AI-generated falsehoods.

The motivation makes sense to me, but it is unclear to what degree a participant's behavior in the artificial context of the study would resemble or deviate from their behavior on social media, where there are real social stakes. Adding some discussion of this could benefit the paper, potentially including the details of how much time your users spent on the study. This could also appear in a limitations section.

> We will add the hallucination generation prompt to the appendix, shown in our response to Reviewer QkWo below.

Thank you. This addresses my third limitation from the original review.

> All genuine and hallucinated texts were generated by GPT-3.5-Turbo. If genuine texts were human-written, paraphrasing them with the LLM could be useful. However, in our case, as the genuine and hallucinated texts all have the same source, it could introduce redundancy and complicate the design.

This addresses concern #2, which was based on a misunderstanding. Given that genuine text is already model-generated, I agree it would be redundant to add a summarization condition.

Given the authors' response, I have raised my score. I encourage the authors to add discussion relevant to point #1 in revisions.

[Authors]: Thank you so much! We will add the discussions relevant to point #1 in our revision."

[Authors]: Per COLM’s approval for additional comments during the discussion phase, below, we provide further details to some of the questions you asked. Thank you for the detailed review. We are sorry for the brevity and formatting issues in the rebuttal, owing to the 2500 characters limit. We address your concerns 3, 4, 6-8 here and will include the explanations in our revision.

3.Here, F=F-statistic, p=p-value, and η^2_p=eta-squared, noting effect size: reported from mixed analysis of variances (ANOVAs) test using SPSS. We explain the rationale behind using mixed ANOVA in response 10: ""we used mixed ANOVA following prior work [12,13], a standard statistical technique given our study design with one between-subjects factor (warn vs. con) and one within-subjects factor (genuine vs. minor vs. major hallucination), both of which are categorical variables.""

4.These are the perceived accuracies for each condition. We provide the rationale in response 5: “perceived accuracy is a widely accepted metric in misinformation literature[12-15]. Participants were asked ""How accurate do you think the answer is?” and they rated the accuracy on a 5-point scale, e.g., “CON: genuine: 3.978, minor: 3.287, major: 2.563” indicates that participants in the control condition rated genuine contents as more accurate compared to minor and major hallucination, as the perceived accuracy for genuine contents (3.978) is greater than those for minor (3.287) and major (2.563) hallucinations.

6.These are the post-hoc test results for minor hallucination, major hallucination, and genuine contents, respectively, conducted using Bonferroni correction in SPSS (F=F-statistic, p=p-value, η2p=effect size). “Minor: F(1,419) = 5.011, p = .026, η2p = 0.012” indicates participants in WARN condition were better at detecting minor hallucination than CON (F-statistic=5.011, statistically significant with p < .05) with small effect size(effect size: 0.01[small]<n2p<0.06, [medium]). 

7.Owing to a scarcity of space, we presented the results of the correlation analysis in detail in the appendix (A.3.2, Table 4) and discussed the highlights in the results section. Table 4 is explained in detail in the following response.

8.Table 4 shows the pairwise correlations between user engagement measures (e.g., dislike and share) and the pairwise correlations between user engagement measures and perceived accuracy (e.g., perceived accuracy and dislike). We use Spearman’s correlation coefficients (r_s) to measure correlation and explain the rationale in response 10: “as we were interested in whether the variables were monotonically related”, even if the relationship is nonlinear. We also use the z-test for pairwise comparisons between correlation coefficients, to examine if the differences in coefficients were statistically significant. 

For instance, Row 6 in Table 4 indicates the correlations between perceived accuracy and dislike. For ease of explanation, we copy only Rows 1 and 6 alongside the table caption from the paper.

| Correlation                 | Genuine   | Minor     | Major     | CON       | WARN      | Significant pairwise Comparisons |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Perceived accuracy, Dislike | -0.457*** | -0.650*** | -0.685*** | -0.664*** | -0.590*** | gn-mi***, gn-mj***               |		 	 

Table 4: The pairwise correlations for (1) different user engagement measures and (2) perceived accuracy and user engagement measures. The correlations are Spearman’s correlation coefficients (r_s), where (***: p_s < 0.001, **: p_s < 0.01, *: p_s < 0.05). The significant pairwise comparisons are obtained using z-test (***: p < 0.001, **: p < 0.01, *: p < 0.05).

Examining the correlations between perceived accuracy and dislike for each within-subjects (genuine, minor, major) and between-subjects condition (WARN, CON), we observe that all column values are negative and highly statistically significant (*** indicates that the p-value for r_s, p_s < .001), i.e., when perceived accuracy increases, dislike decreases, indicating that participants are less likely to dislike a content if they perceive it as accurate, across content types and warning conditions.

In addition, there are two significant pairwise comparisons (genuine-minor and genuine-major) with high statistical significance (*** indicates that p-value for z-test, p < .001), as the correlation between perceived accuracy and dislike for genuine contents (-0.457) is less negative compared to minor (-0.650) and major (-0.685). These results suggest greater cohesion between perceived accuracy and dislike for minor and major hallucinations compared to genuine contents.

[Authors]: Since the term hallucination is fundamental for our study and as we authors and the reviewer seem to disagree on its precise definition, we reiterate and provide more details on our use of the term hallucination here. Using the reference [1–8] that the reviewer provided and [9-11] that we further identified, here is our analysis:

* IDENTICAL definition: [1,3,7, 9-11] define hallucination as generated content that is nonsensical or unverifiable, without noting intrinsic limitations. This is the identical definition as ours. 

* Non-Identical or Non-Conflicting definition: Relevant works where the definition of hallucination (1) does not match with ours but also does not conflict [2, 4, 8] or (2) does not match [5] also cite hallucination benchmark datasets [9, 11] that manually inject non-factual information or use fake news as prompts. Consequently, we argue that our use of the term “hallucination” is acceptable.

Below, please find the definitions of hallucinations from the cited literature.

> We respectfully disagree with the point about forget quality not being the right measure of unlearning.

This wasn't my claim. I'm not saying forget quality is not the right metric. I'm implying forget quality is not equivalent to unlearning, which seems to be the takeaway while reading the paper. 

Let's take a step back and understand how approximate unlearning was defined in the first place. [1] and many other works during that time defined unlearning using differential privacy. It involves developing techniques that outputs model parameters which would be estimated with similar probability even if parameter  estimation happened with the deleted sample not being there in the original training set. With this definition, unlearning is good even if the model's forget quality is poor.

Let me try to explain this with a very simple counter example. If you are trying to fit a straight line with 3 colinear points and then you delete the middle point. The resultant function is still the same straight line, and you would get good prediction ability for that middle point. But the unlearning is still **perfect** in this case.

Therefore, justifying forget quality as a core unlearning metric requires extra care. We should claim that it is an important metric in many application-driven scenarios. This is what [2] did. 

[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03279

[2] https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/062d711fb777322e2152435459e6e9d9-Paper-Conference.pdf

> Forget quality is the central definition of unlearning that we use. It is not supposed to change whether unlearning was intended for bias or privacy. 

I'm sorry but I'm not sure if this statement has enough theoretical backing.

> Predictive multiplicity

I don't think my concern regarding predictive multiplicity has been addressed. Predictive multiplicity has nothing to do with the number of samples you're evaluating on but instead the model you trained on the retain set. Models trained with different hyperparameters can result in very different outputs on the test set. This can negatively penalize one baseline over the other. 

> Weak Baselines

The baselines I mentioned have nothing specific for classification. Several of the techniques rely on gradient estimation of the final loss, which is easily available for LLM generation. In general, it is not right to ignore state-of-the-art unlearning techniques just because they were proposed 1-2 years before the advent of LLMs.

[Authors]: Thank you for your feedback and for the opportunity to clarify our stance further. Below, we address your concerns more explicitly under separate headings:

**Forget Quality vs Unlearning**

You raised a valid concern about the distinction between forget quality and unlearning, particularly in the context of differential privacy (DP). We acknowledge that our forget quality metric is not directly measuring the theoretical notion of approximate unlearning from the DP perspective. Instead, our work takes a practical approach, focusing on the empirical measurement of a model's ability to ""forget"" information related to the deleted samples. There is also a line of work that attempts to give more practical definitions to generative model privacy (e.g. copyright infringement), and our measure can be viewed as an instance of [1] with a special divergence.

The forget quality metric is designed to capture the similarity between the output distributions of the forget model (trained after deletion) and the retain model (trained without the deleted samples). While it may not strictly align with the DP-based definition of unlearning, it serves our purpose of evaluating the practical effectiveness of unlearning techniques for large language models (LLMs). 

For your counter-example, since the two estimators (before and after deletion, forget model, and retain model respectively) are identical, they will have the same truth ratio. The KS test will suggest that they have the same distribution (of course, to be rigorous, these estimators have to be randomized, etc), hence good forget quality. So our method works here. *Importantly, our forget quality is not encouraging that the forget model should perform badly on the forget set, rather it should behave similarly to the retain model.*

To give you more intuition of the KS test, if the model is functionally equivalent to a retain model at “most” point in its input domain, the model “acts” equivalent to a perfectly unlearned model (in the sense of their output distributions, rather than the parameter distributions). This is precisely what the KS test aims to capture. While it can not exhaustively test the model at each and every point, the goal is to assess the fidelity of the “unlearned model” to the retain model, via a statistical KS test. To summarize, the KS test is a statistical test between the truth ratio of the retain and unlearn model on various question-answer pairs in the dataset.

Finally, we understand that you want us to be upfront about this distinction in the paper, and we agree with this aspect. We will make it a point to clarify this early in the draft to ensure our readers carry forward the correct message. We appreciate your detailed engagement on this issue!

This directly relates to the second point you raised. The goal of this work is to strive towards an “empirical notion” of unlearning that can scale. We use “forget quality” as defined by the above fidelity test, as a definition for this empirical notion, which is an all-encompassing umbrella term for both privacy and bias.

**Predictive Multiplicity**

We appreciate your concern about predictive multiplicity and the potential impact of different hyperparameters on the retain model's performance. In our work, we took measures to address this issue. As shown in **Appendix G**, we conducted extensive experiments to assess the robustness of the KS test to different training scenarios for the retain model.

Our findings indicate that the KS test is quite stable and provides consistent results across various hyperparameter settings for the retain model. We trained multiple retain models with different hyperparameters, such as varying degrees of dataset overlap and weight decay, and observed low variance in the outcomes of the KS test.

While we acknowledge the theoretical possibility of pathological cases where the retain model could negatively impact the evaluation, our empirical results suggest that the KS test is reliable in practical settings, even when the retain model is trained under different conditions.

[Authors]: **Baselines**

We believe we conveyed our goals with the baselines in the previous response. We understand your concern about not considering adaptations of state-of-the-art unlearning techniques in the non-LLM literature. 

We implemented four competitive baselines, each targeted towards a different unlearning philosophy (such as abstaining v.s answering wrong, and so on). One of these (see equation 7 of our paper) also captures the essence of existing approaches, such as SCRUB (as suggested by you). We will also add that citation. While there may not be exact 1-1 correspondence, on closer look the methods intend to do the same. We want to highlight that adapting past approaches to the LLM space is non-trivial. We tried various methods during our initial exploration of TOFU. This included low-rank modifications, final layer edits, adapter weights, DPO, and so on. These methods did not work well out of the box, and discussion on them was not included in the paper. We can already foresee how NTK forgetting for instance, will face similar challenges. In fact, Fisher/NTK type forgetting is hard to adapt to the LLM regime also due to the exceptionally high dimensionality of the output layer (which leads to the construction of at least 600k * 600k matrix, say we are forgetting 10 examples, and the vocab size is 60k, see discussion in [2]). We want to highlight that these adaptations are outside the scope of our work.

We acknowledge that there may be additional techniques that could be explored, which is why TOFU is a benchmark paper, and not a methods paper. We welcome contributions from researchers to build upon our work and advance the field of unlearning for large language models.

[Reviewer_bGRo]: I would like to thank the authors for such a detailed response. 

I am raising my score on the **condition** that the authors make the following two changes in the draft: (a) the distinction between approximate unlearning and empirical unlearning more clear in the beginning of the paper, and  (b) I would also request the authors to add the necessary details about why the requested baselines would not work for LLMs (this can be in the appendix). 

> Fischer and NTK forgetting

You can make the forgetting tractable by deleting one instance at a time and using a diagonal approximation of the fischer matrix. But I understand that these baselines aren't the focus of this work.

> Evaluation & Predictive multiplicity

I'm still not happy with the evaluation scheme. I agree that KS Test is a meaningful metric but the fact that it requires a model trained on the retain set bothers me. However, I'm willing to make an exception since the primary contribution of the paper is the introduction of the new benchmark, which will be helpful for future studies.

I understand TOFU allows a controlled experimental setup. Still, the statement about ""controlling exactly how much exposure models get to them"" can lead to misunderstanding, as it may hint at experiments of varying degrees of exposure. I believe this should be fixed in the revision.

Furthermore, each person may be related to the other, and unlearning becomes complex if one has to be erased and not the other.

> We respectfully disagree with the point about forget quality not being the right measure of unlearning.

This wasn't my claim. I'm not saying forget quality is not the right metric. I'm implying forget quality is not equivalent to unlearning, which seems to be the takeaway while reading the paper. 

Let's take a step back and understand how approximate unlearning was defined in the first place. [1] and many other works during that time defined unlearning using differential privacy. It involves developing techniques that outputs model parameters which would be estimated with similar probability even if parameter  estimation happened with the deleted sample not being there in the original training set. With this definition, unlearning is good even if the model's forget quality is poor.

Let me try to explain this with a very simple counter example. If you are trying to fit a straight line with 3 colinear points and then you delete the middle point. The resultant function is still the same straight line, and you would get good prediction ability for that middle point. But the unlearning is still **perfect** in this case.

Therefore, justifying forget quality as a core unlearning metric requires extra care. We should claim that it is an important metric in many application-driven scenarios. This is what [2] did. 

[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03279

[2] https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/062d711fb777322e2152435459e6e9d9-Paper-Conference.pdf

> Forget quality is the central definition of unlearning that we use. It is not supposed to change whether unlearning was intended for bias or privacy. 

I'm sorry but I'm not sure if this statement has enough theoretical backing.

> Predictive multiplicity

I don't think my concern regarding predictive multiplicity has been addressed. Predictive multiplicity has nothing to do with the number of samples you're evaluating on but instead the model you trained on the retain set. Models trained with different hyperparameters can result in very different outputs on the test set. This can negatively penalize one baseline over the other. 

> Weak Baselines

The baselines I mentioned have nothing specific for classification. Several of the techniques rely on gradient estimation of the final loss, which is easily available for LLM generation. In general, it is not right to ignore state-of-the-art unlearning techniques just because they were proposed 1-2 years before the advent of LLMs.

[Authors]: Thank you for your feedback and for the opportunity to clarify our stance further. Below, we address your concerns more explicitly under separate headings:

**Forget Quality vs Unlearning**

You raised a valid concern about the distinction between forget quality and unlearning, particularly in the context of differential privacy (DP). We acknowledge that our forget quality metric is not directly measuring the theoretical notion of approximate unlearning from the DP perspective. Instead, our work takes a practical approach, focusing on the empirical measurement of a model's ability to ""forget"" information related to the deleted samples. There is also a line of work that attempts to give more practical definitions to generative model privacy (e.g. copyright infringement), and our measure can be viewed as an instance of [1] with a special divergence.

The forget quality metric is designed to capture the similarity between the output distributions of the forget model (trained after deletion) and the retain model (trained without the deleted samples). While it may not strictly align with the DP-based definition of unlearning, it serves our purpose of evaluating the practical effectiveness of unlearning techniques for large language models (LLMs). 

For your counter-example, since the two estimators (before and after deletion, forget model, and retain model respectively) are identical, they will have the same truth ratio. The KS test will suggest that they have the same distribution (of course, to be rigorous, these estimators have to be randomized, etc), hence good forget quality. So our method works here. *Importantly, our forget quality is not encouraging that the forget model should perform badly on the forget set, rather it should behave similarly to the retain model.*

To give you more intuition of the KS test, if the model is functionally equivalent to a retain model at “most” point in its input domain, the model “acts” equivalent to a perfectly unlearned model (in the sense of their output distributions, rather than the parameter distributions). This is precisely what the KS test aims to capture. While it can not exhaustively test the model at each and every point, the goal is to assess the fidelity of the “unlearned model” to the retain model, via a statistical KS test. To summarize, the KS test is a statistical test between the truth ratio of the retain and unlearn model on various question-answer pairs in the dataset.

Finally, we understand that you want us to be upfront about this distinction in the paper, and we agree with this aspect. We will make it a point to clarify this early in the draft to ensure our readers carry forward the correct message. We appreciate your detailed engagement on this issue!

This directly relates to the second point you raised. The goal of this work is to strive towards an “empirical notion” of unlearning that can scale. We use “forget quality” as defined by the above fidelity test, as a definition for this empirical notion, which is an all-encompassing umbrella term for both privacy and bias.

**Predictive Multiplicity**

We appreciate your concern about predictive multiplicity and the potential impact of different hyperparameters on the retain model's performance. In our work, we took measures to address this issue. As shown in **Appendix G**, we conducted extensive experiments to assess the robustness of the KS test to different training scenarios for the retain model.

Our findings indicate that the KS test is quite stable and provides consistent results across various hyperparameter settings for the retain model. We trained multiple retain models with different hyperparameters, such as varying degrees of dataset overlap and weight decay, and observed low variance in the outcomes of the KS test.

While we acknowledge the theoretical possibility of pathological cases where the retain model could negatively impact the evaluation, our empirical results suggest that the KS test is reliable in practical settings, even when the retain model is trained under different conditions.

[Authors]: **Baselines**

We believe we conveyed our goals with the baselines in the previous response. We understand your concern about not considering adaptations of state-of-the-art unlearning techniques in the non-LLM literature. 

We implemented four competitive baselines, each targeted towards a different unlearning philosophy (such as abstaining v.s answering wrong, and so on). One of these (see equation 7 of our paper) also captures the essence of existing approaches, such as SCRUB (as suggested by you). We will also add that citation. While there may not be exact 1-1 correspondence, on closer look the methods intend to do the same. We want to highlight that adapting past approaches to the LLM space is non-trivial. We tried various methods during our initial exploration of TOFU. This included low-rank modifications, final layer edits, adapter weights, DPO, and so on. These methods did not work well out of the box, and discussion on them was not included in the paper. We can already foresee how NTK forgetting for instance, will face similar challenges. In fact, Fisher/NTK type forgetting is hard to adapt to the LLM regime also due to the exceptionally high dimensionality of the output layer (which leads to the construction of at least 600k * 600k matrix, say we are forgetting 10 examples, and the vocab size is 60k, see discussion in [2]). We want to highlight that these adaptations are outside the scope of our work.

We acknowledge that there may be additional techniques that could be explored, which is why TOFU is a benchmark paper, and not a methods paper. We welcome contributions from researchers to build upon our work and advance the field of unlearning for large language models.

[Reviewer_bGRo]: I would like to thank the authors for such a detailed response. 

I am raising my score on the **condition** that the authors make the following two changes in the draft: (a) the distinction between approximate unlearning and empirical unlearning more clear in the beginning of the paper, and  (b) I would also request the authors to add the necessary details about why the requested baselines would not work for LLMs (this can be in the appendix). 

> Fischer and NTK forgetting

You can make the forgetting tractable by deleting one instance at a time and using a diagonal approximation of the fischer matrix. But I understand that these baselines aren't the focus of this work.

> Evaluation & Predictive multiplicity

I'm still not happy with the evaluation scheme. I agree that KS Test is a meaningful metric but the fact that it requires a model trained on the retain set bothers me. However, I'm willing to make an exception since the primary contribution of the paper is the introduction of the new benchmark, which will be helpful for future studies. 

Once again, I would thank the authors for their responses, which helped me understand the work better.

[Authors]: Thank you very much for your swift response.
We appreciate the opportunity to clarify certain points that may not have been fully explained within the 2500-character limit of the rebuttal:
* **Human evaluation:** We reported intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) in the paper, which is exactly the inter-annotator agreement metric. ICC is especially appropriate for continuous data like ours, while other metrics have assumptions that do not suit the nature of our ratings, e.g. Cohen’s kappa is designed for categorical data. We additionally transform the scores into rankings to calculate Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, which stands at 0.437, indicating a moderate positive correlation.
* **NLI-G study:** The absence of ground truth annotations makes it infeasible to separate error-free from erroneous dialogues. As explained in the rebuttal, our conclusion is inferred logically, and the results demonstrate effective evidence retrieval for NLI-G over the Prev setting. We would appreciate your feedback if there are specific aspects of our inference process you believe could be improved.

We hope these clarifications address your concerns. 

Furthermore, we had prepared more detailed responses to the questions raised in the original review, which we had to extensively trim in the rebuttal due to the character limit.

* **More Detailed Responses to the Original Review:**
## Prior work discussion
We will append the related work section with the recommended LLM agent papers.

We especially explain the major differences between our work and the two suggested papers, LEGO (He et al., 2023) and ToM for Multi-Agent Collaboration (Li et al., 2023): 
* **Task:** We address errors in long-term open-domain dialogues between multiple agents. In contrast, Li et al. (2023) tackle the goal-oriented task of defusing bombs in multiple rooms, while He et al. (2023) combine LLM outputs for causality explanation generation, assigning different roles to LLMs to analyze cause and effect, mine knowledge, generate explanations, and refine the explanations.
* **Approach:**
    * We develop an error detection and correction framework for each agent’s utterance, while there is no such mechanism in Li et al. (2023). In addition, our task is more challenging. Our agents’ dialogue history and memory contain information about multiple agents, while Li et al. (2023) agents track only task-related information in their belief states, such as bomb locations and colors. Li et al. deal with only 3 agents and 3 colors of bombs in 5 rooms, with clearly defined states to track due to their goal-oriented nature. In contrast, our task involves complex information propagation in open-domain dialogues between 25 agents, each with distinct and varied personal traits. This complexity is particularly challenging given that language models struggle with maintaining self-identity [1]. For instance, the errors illustrated in Figure 1 of our paper are less likely to occur when the agents are discussing bombs.

        [1] Shuster et al., “Am I me or you? State-of-the-art dialogue models cannot maintain an identity.” NAACL-Findings, 2022. 
    * We propose NLI-G and use local models to retrieve evidence from past dialogues for potential errors, whereas He et al. (2023) utilize three additional LLM modules to analyze cause/effect and retrieve world knowledge from Wikipedia.
## Elements in Ablation study
Q2. Memory, history, background, and status constitute the context for utterance generation, originating from GenerativeAgents.
- Memory: formed by observation and reflection mechanisms, e.g. ""People are interested in fostering creativity and innovation.""
- History: previous dialogues of the involved agents
- Background: agent’s predefined characteristics such as personality, age, profession, current projects, etc. E.g. ""Abigail Chen is a digital artist and animator who loves to explore how technology can be used to express ideas.""
- Status: the agent's action before the current dialogue, e.g., ""working on her animation project.""

[Authors]: We greatly appreciate your raising your score! 

Are you asking about the relationship between our terminology of “stability” and “the size of the gradient”? We say an unlearning algorithm is stable if all samples are unlearned, the gradient should vanish. Otherwise, if the gradient is still large after all samples are unlearned, the parameters will diverge quickly. GA is unstable because the gradient remains non-vanishing even after a sample is effectively unlearned. NPO will be much more stable because, for unlearned samples, its gradient will be small, causing the model to stop training as soon as all samples are unlearned."

407,Large Language Model is not a (Multilingual) Compositional Relation Reasoner,Accept,8sWc8h0f4d,,,,"[Authors]: We apologize if our previous explanation was unclear. Allow me to provide a more detailed description.

__Creation Procedure__

We have employed a group of graduate students, including authors, and divided them into three distinct roles: question creators, answer verifiers and quality checkers.

In the question-creating stage, we sourced texts from various online platforms, such as social media and Wikipedia. We gathered simple relationships within these texts. For example, comparative relationships like '[entity A] is more [adj] than [entity B]' were patterns we searched for. We then trained a group of seven workers to integrate different relationships and rephrase them into questions.

Following this, we assigned four workers as answer verifiers. Each question was distributed to two workers, and we removed the question if both workers answered incorrectly. This procedure helped us filter out roughly 10% of the initial questions, ensuring a higher level of accuracy.

Lastly, we trained two workers to assess the quality of both the questions and their corresponding answers. These workers had access to complete information, focusing particularly on detecting any potential ambiguities in the questions. This final step was crucial in maintaining the integrity and clarity of our question set.

__Human Accuracy__

We are sorry that we did not conduct extensive human experiments. Based on the results from the answer verifiers, the human accuracy for the remaining questions is approximately 91.2%.


Please let me know if you have concerns."
407,Large Language Model is not a (Multilingual) Compositional Relation Reasoner,Accept,U7BpOBpsnu,,,,"[Reviewer_qSX2]: thank you for your response. a few follow ups:

>Do models tend to get the same examples correct or incorrect?

I mean to ask among the experiments you ran on your datasets did the models you evaluated get the same examples correct? the same ones incorrect? e.g. pick two models and see counts of {Both Correct, Both Incorrect, Model 1 correct only, Model 2 correct only}. Is this more clear?

>Why are there only five-shot results for ChatGPT?

I mean to ask -- am I missing five shot results with other models?

>Can you say more about where error cases occur?

Can you say more? Are there any common trends I should be thinking of beyond what is mentioned in the paper?

>Is my dad’s mom’s husband my grandpa?

I guess my suggestion would be to assess a subset of questions to determine the percentage that are unambiguous.

[Authors]: Thanks for your explanation, below is our response.

__Why are there only five-shot results for ChatGPT?__

We rerun the 5-shot experiments on all models on English(EN) and Chinese(ZH).
|   model  |   prompt |    EN    |   ZH  | 
|-----------|------------|----------|------|
| Llama2 7B|  ZS       |    30.1   |  24.8 |
|   |   5-shot |    30.64  |  24.7|
|   |      ZSC  |    35.2 | 24.5|
| Llama2 13B|  ZS       |    38.8   | 31.9|
|   |   5-shot |    38.0  |  32.2|
|   |      ZSC  |    36.4 | 33.0|
| Mistral 7B|  ZS       |  34.9 | 40.1   |
|   |   5-shot |    36.87  |  40.84 |
|   |      ZSC  |    47.5 | 40.3|
| GPT-3|  ZS       |    31.8   |  20.0
|   |   5-shot |    25.78  |  31.44|
|   |      ZSC  |    29.6 |  15.6 |
| ChatGPT|  ZS       |    39.3   | 41.1|
|   |   5-shot |    40.5  |   40.1 |
|   |      ZSC  |    46.5 | 44.3|
| GPT-4|  ZS       |    71.6   | 58.0 |
|   |   5-shot |    74.7  |  65.84  |
|   |      ZSC  |    75.2 |  61.4 |

__Do models tend to get the same examples correct or incorrect?__

The answer varies based on the model we pick. Use Chinese ZSC as an example, below are the statistics we have to compare GPT-4 as 3 other models, all the numbers are in percentage:

1. GPT-4 vs ChatGPT
|  | | ChatGPT| |
|--|-|--------|-----------|
|   | |correct| incorrect|
|GPT-4|correct|39.4|22|
| |incorrect|4.9|33.7|

2. GPT-4 vs Llama2 7B
|  | | Llama2 7B| |
|--|-|--------|-----------|
|   | |correct| incorrect|
|GPT-4|correct|16.6|44.8|
| |incorrect|3.7|34.9|

3. GPT-4 vs Mistral 7B
|  | | Mistral 7B| |
|--|-|--------|-----------|
|   | |correct| incorrect|
|GPT-4|correct|25.7|35.6|
| |incorrect|14.6|24|

We find that although ChatGPT and Mistral 7b have very close performances (40.3/44.3 for ZH ZSC), they tend to have different distributions in this experiment. ChatGPT has higher both correct and incorrect compared with Mistral 7B.  This might be due to the difference in model architecture, pre-train/finetuning data, pre-train method, etc.

__Can you say more about where error cases occur?__

Below are our conclusions:

__1__. We observed a pattern in the errors present in the benchmark. When the symbols connecting two relations are identical, LLMs are less likely to make mistakes. For example, if A is greater than B, and B is greater than C, the LLM can easily deduce that A is greater than C. 

However,  use ChatGPT as an example, if we change one relation symbol in the question: 

""if A is greater than B, C is smaller than B,  and C is greater than D, then A is __ than D.

A) greater

B) smaller

C) Uncertain""

The thought its output would be 

""If A is greater than B, and C is smaller than B but greater than D, we cannot definitively determine the relationship between A and D. It depends on the specific values of A, B, C, and D. So, the correct answer would be:
C. Uncertain"" 

which is incorrect.

This might also be the reason that for the question ""A is 100 meters to the left of B, and B is 100 meters to the right of C, where is A in relation to C?"", ChatGPT chooses the incorrect answer""100 meters to the right."".

__2__. When the symbols connecting two relations are identical, but the relation between two asking objects is uncertain, the   LLM tends to answer the relation it seen in the question, for example:

""The hospital is west of the Supermarket, and the school is west of the supermarket. In which direction is the hospital from the school?

A. the hospital is west of the school

B.  the hospital is east of the school

C. Uncertain""

ChatGPT outputs ""Given that both the hospital and the school are located to the west of the supermarket, we can conclude that the hospital is west of the school as well. So, the correct answer is:

A. the hospital is west of the school"" 

where the correct answer should be ""Uncertain"".

__3__ We noticed that how the question being asked also matters.

If we ask ChatGPT:

""Mike is Amy's father; John is Mike's father; then John is Amy's?

A.  father

B. grandfather

C. son

D. uncertain""

in this question, John is the subject in both the relation we provided and the question, ChatGPT outputs 

""If John is Mike's father and Mike is Amy's father, then John is Amy's grandfather. So, the correct answer is:

B. grandfather"" which is the correct answer.

But if we change the prompt to  

""Mike is Amy's father; John is Mike's father; then Amy is John's?

A.  daughter

B. grandchild

C. mother

D. uncertain""

The output becomes 

""Amy is John's daughter. So, the correct answer is:

A. daughter"" which is clearly a wrong answer.

__Is my dad’s mom’s husband my grandpa?__

Thanks again for your suggestion. We will re-examine the questions and remove these ambiguous questions from the final version.

[Reviewer_qSX2]: Thank you so much. This kind of analysis I believe greatly strengthens the paper. I would recommend adding all of these results to the paper and even doing more of such analysis."

First, ""combining DBS with SC adds no time."" This comment is not accurate. Increasing the beam size will significantly improve the KV caching and computing power of GPUs. Especially, in DBS, the definition of each step is not very clear to the model. A streaming inference engine cannot know which token to split and merge. Also, the communication between the LM and the verifier model will also significantly increase the delay.

Second, BBH is designed to evaluate how well models can solve complex tasks and reasoning capability is one of their focuses. BBH is also a popular dataset used in many recent LLM evaluation packages.

[Authors]: Thanks for your prompt reply. We are glad that we have addressed your other major concerns about **performance on self-consistency** and **missing comparisons**. We now would like to clarify the other two arguments.

> Inference Time

Thanks for bringing the inference time up. Actually, “combining DBS with SC adds no time” is the response to your concern about “Methods should directly compare rather than add”. DBS can cache all finished reasoning paths during inference. Thus, users can directly apply self-consistency on the DBS-generated reasoning paths, which makes DBS+SC add no time compared to DBS alone. \
As for your concern on DBS increasing inference time, we admit that applying DBS indeed increases inference time and may be challenging to be deployed as a delay-sensitive system in the near future. Yet, being able to be used directly in the real-world systems is *one of the many forms of metric* to evaluate the scientific contributions. We would like to highlight again that although accurate reasoning is more time-consuming, it catalyzes stronger models [1,2,3,4]. The cited works all use *“time-consuming”* sampling methods, which synthesize accurate reasoning paths, and finally breeds more powerful models. Moreover, as we have discussed in the response to Reviewer 2vf7, we compare the DBS inference time with self-consistency, where the additional time cost is primarily introduced by the small verifier, and verifier inference time is 0.1x of LLM inference time. Ultimately, in terms of future impacts, we believe that accuracy is a critical factor for stronger models. \
Thanks again for pointing out the limitation from the immediate use perspective, we will add more discussions in terms of inference speed in the future revision.

> Big Bench Hard

Thanks for the suggestion. We respectfully suggest that BBH may not be indispensable for work focusing on reasoning ability. As you pointed out, “reasoning capability is one of their focuses.” Given the multitude of abilities involved, including natural language understanding, it can be challenging to evaluate **reasoning ability**. Moreover, in recent works focusing on improving reasoning ability [5,6,7,8,9,10], BBH is not necessarily evaluated to demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning. We are happy to discuss more if you could possible consider elaborating more.

Thanks again for your valuable suggestions and for being willing to discuss, let us know if you have any other questions.

[Reviewer_R7sC]: Thanks for the reply. However, I still tend to keep my original rating because the two main arguments do not convince me.

First, ""combining DBS with SC adds no time."" This comment is not accurate. Increasing the beam size will significantly improve the KV caching and computing power of GPUs. Especially, in DBS, the definition of each step is not very clear to the model. A streaming inference engine cannot know which token to split and merge. Also, the communication between the LM and the verifier model will also significantly increase the delay.

Second, BBH is designed to evaluate how well models can solve complex tasks and reasoning capability is one of their focuses. BBH is also a popular dataset used in many recent LLM evaluation packages.

[Reviewer_kZfw]: Thanks for the response, and glad to hear you will be releasing the dataset!

As for the motivation for the 0-100 scale: it is still not clear to me why such a large scale was selected, though I can see that this is not a crucial design choice. I'd encourage you to make this a little more clear in the paper (that a scale with so many intervals is not needed, and the same results could (likely?) be achieved with a scale with fewer intervals but no multiple-of-5 limitation).

>While Avg EBR is comparable, it is still a four-point scale. It lacks the fine-grained aspect of evaluation which our approach enables us to achieve. EBR gives us the ability to tease out differences in human judgment and be more nuanced which otherwise is not possible with a four-point scale.

I may be misunderstanding Table 3, but doesn't it follow from a comparable MAE between avg. EBR and EBR, meaning that each method's error in aligning with human judgement scores (0-100) is about the same, that either 1) a more fine-grained scale *does not* give the ability to tease out differences in human judgment, or 2) the human judgements do not have such nuances? I see nuanced human judgements in Figure 4a, so I assumed it was the former.

I will keep my score."

[Reviewer_67Nb]: I appreciate authors' efforts to address my questions. 

While I now better understand the paper, the presentation part -- particularly how the parameters are modified at the first stage --- is still unclear. Also, in the case of expert network (W_down^expert & W_merge) , it is still not very convincing to me why we need to prepare two types of neurons -- neuron and weight neurons, so requiring better explaination and motivation. It seems that the use of only a single type of neuron enables to handlie the required behaviors. Otherwise, a kind of justification and abliation studies may be necessary. 

Overall, I like the basic idea of this paper, as a good extension of T-patcher, with promising performances. 
So, I have increased my recommendation score up to 7.

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer 67Nb,

Thank you for increasing the score! 

Sorry, our reply may not be clear enough.For some unclear points, please refer to the following explanations:

The expert network trained in the first stage is referred to as $W_{down}$. During training, we freeze the other weights and only train this particular weight. The reason for using indexing neurons is to accurately call the corresponding expert network during inference.

The use of a two-stage process ensures non-interference and offers better performance on the dataset. In [5GUJ], it can be observed that SCEN, by adopting a two-stage process, has fewer erroneously activated neurons.

We will further revise our paper for the camera-ready version, hoping to address all your concerns by then. We are grateful for your recommendation once again."

# Method Elaboration
We will emphasize that domain specification is primarily conceptual and qualitative, relying on expert knowledge and understanding of the business context. Specifically, we will:
1. Explain the conceptual principles used:
      - Mutual exclusivity: each subdomain should be distinct and non-overlapping
      - Collective exhaustiveness: all relevant aspects of the domain should be covered
2. Elaborate on the qualitative prioritization process:
      - Priorities are assigned based on expert judgment of subdomain relevance
      - Consideration is given to alignment with specific business objectives and focus areas
      - The prioritization is conducted through discussions with domain experts and stakeholders (e.g. managers of the relevant businesses)
3. Provide a step-by-step guide on applying this qualitative methodology in the example logistics industry context:
      - Begin with identifying the most granular, relevant subdomains based on expert knowledge
      - Iteratively combine these granular subdomains into broader, more comprehensive categories
      - Assign priorities to each subdomain and category based on their determined relevance and business alignment
      - Continue this process until a sufficiently comprehensive domain specification is constructed
4. Include concrete examples to illustrate each step of the conceptual process for a general audience: 
      - Demonstrate how ""Intracity Freight Transportation"" is identified as the most granular, highest priority subdomain
      - Show how it is combined with other subdomains like ""Intercity Freight Transportation"" into the broader ""Road Transportation"" category
      - Explain how priority levels are assigned qualitatively based on Huolala's business focus and expert judgment

# Lower Scores of GPT-4
From the detailed results of all 12 capability dimensions, the lower scores of the foundation model GPT-4 are likely due to the absence of proprietary information used to fine-tune the PLLMs. They performed better on general capabilities.

[Authors]: # Contribution and Comparison to Previous Framework
There is no standardized end-to-end (from domain specification to criteria/dataset/rubrics construction to result interpretation) human evaluation protocols that meet industry-level domain needs currently, scoring metrics and and corresponding interpretation are only part of LalaEval, so LalaEval is the first holistic human evaluation conceptual framework for domain-specific LLMs, addressing the lack of standardized protocols in existing literature and it is hard to be compared to previous paradigms. Given the open-generation nature of LLM output and the high stakes of large-scale real-world domain-specific LLM deployments, LalaEval aims to reduce overall human-in-the-loop evaluation subjectivity, to ensure objective and aligned evaluation results and/or further guide our LLM development. Existing literature primarily mentions human evaluation of specific tasks without detailing implementation, standardization or even protocols (See Section 5.2 of A Survey on Evaluation of Large Language Models, arXiv:2307.03109 for a detailed review). LalaEval fills this gap by proposing protocols for domain specification, criteria/dataset/rubrics construction, result analysis including reliability measurement and a systematic integration of these components. Furthermore, our deployed framework in a real-world production setting demonstrates its practical effectiveness, contributing valuable LLM-related industry (esp. non-tech) insights.

**“PubChem and MoleculeNet are not used for instruction tuning for the first time”**

Sorry for the inaccurate expression. We meant to say that they are used for the first time for many of our carefully selected tasks (and why we selected these tasks was described in Section 3.1), and we made non-trivial efforts in preparing the data for instruction tuning on such tasks. Specifically:

- Although PubChem has been used for instruction tuning in 3D-MoLM [1], it is for the molecule-text interpretation task, instead of our name conversion tasks. To create data for name conversion, we collected and sampled compound data points from PubChem, extracted their multiple representations, and removed those data points with invalid SMILES or incomplete domains (i.e., data points with no SMILES/IUPAC/Molecular formula specified). 
- MoleculeNet is used for instruction tuning on properties like solubility and side effects for the first time, while Mol-Instructions only uses the QM9 dataset of MoleculeNet for energy value prediction. We intentionally and carefully chose these included properties, because domain experts suggested that they are very important and related to real-world applications like drug discovery. Besides rigorously examining data quality and fixing some issues, we put a lot of effort in creating instructions for the side effect dataset (PP-SIDER): we first removed some side effect labels whose names are not clear and specific enough for instruction tuning (e.g., Investigations), and manually created the instruction questions for each of the side effects to ensure they are correct and diverse.

In conclusion, we used PubChem and MoleculeNet for instruction tuning on many carefully selected tasks for the first time, and applied non-trivial and tailored methods to process the data. Therefore, the set of instruction tuning data created by us is novel and should contribute to the area.

We primarily focus on evaluating LLMs on chemistry, especially those generalist models that can handle multiple tasks by following natural language instructions. There are indeed many existing works for each of the tasks in our proposed benchmark, and due to paper length and resource limit, we are not able to discuss or compare with many of them, but only choose one of the most representative SoTA models for each task and report its results. That said, we agree with the reviewer, and will add more discussions on [1, 3] in our updated manuscript and compare with them on applicable tasks.

> Evaluate the faithfulness

Sorry for not explaining this clearly in the text. ""Assign"" is a process of LLM-based evaluation. The Retriever is instructed to evaluate candidates' answers by considering the faithfulness between the reasoning process and their answers. Here, we use definition of faithfulness: “if the reasoning process derived from the model can accurately be expressed by an explanation, we call it faithful.”[1,2] 

It is essentially an LLM evaluating the generated content of other LLMs. We will further clarify these details in the revision.

> Similar Cost-effective Experiments on Other Benchmarks 

Yes, the main paper presents AddSub as a mathematical task. In Appendix D.3, we presented results for ARC-c and Penguins, which correspond to commonsense and symbolic tasks, respectively. Due to the high testing costs for TableQA-type tasks, we currently have not conducted those experiments. We will try to include these in the revision.

> ""Multiple Attempts"" 

We agree that execution signals and error feedback would improve the overall review process. In real-world scenarios, this would enhance the effectiveness of the entire system. In the rebuttal, our reference to ""multiple attempts"" means that in general reasoning tasks, errors such as (I) code execution failures or (II) code execution correctness but incorrect answers are both counted as errors. Therefore, for evaluating reasoning tasks, if execution feedback is provided in each round, it validates whether type I errors occur in every review. Compared to methods like PAL/PoT, incorporating execution signals provides additional ""verification"" opportunities.

365,Elephants Never Forget: Memorization and Learning of Tabular Data in Large Language Models,Accept,3KHrW3mxpo,,,,"[Reviewer_odGz]: Thanks for the interesting response. The reference to Oswald et al. 2023 would have helped me lot, to understand the general background of this work.

Regarding the memorization tests, I am still not entirely happy. Could you give some more details as to how you defined ""memorization"" quantitatively? Or is Table 2 obtained from ""eyeballing""/manually checking the test battery results?

Your explanation on the adult dataset suggests that memorization is not a binary thing, but that LLMs sometimes seem to memorize particular parts of a dataset.  This is an interesting observation, but it is not discussed in the paper if I am not mistaken. What would be the consequences of ""partial memorization""? Do you think that it differs from ""full memorization""?

[Authors]: Thanks for your response!

Although the memorization tests lead to quantitative results, such as the number of rows that were correctly completed, we don't define memorization quantitatively.

Our notion of memorization follows the approach outlined in a series of papers on memorization in LLMs, most importantly Carlini et al. 2019 https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08232 and Carlini et al. 2021 https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07805.

Following this literature, we say a text is memorized if a model can consistently generate it.

Of course, this makes sense only for texts that contain sufficient entropy so that the probability of generating the text by chance or prediction is close to zero.

In our context of tabular datasets, we rely on the fact that these datasets contain random variables: It is impossible to consistently reproduce the realizations of random variables unless the values of the random variables have been seen before (i.e., during pre-training). 

For example, the OpenML Diabetes dataset contains an individual's glucose level, blood pressure, and BMI, as well as other measurements that are at least in part random. Now, if an LLM can consistently generate entire rows of this dataset, this is evidence of memorization. We note that this approach has been lightly formalized in the two papers referenced above, where the authors use the term ""canary.""

In judging memorization, one has to consider the completion rate of the LLM and the amount of entropy in the dataset. To give another example, the Iris dataset contains many rows that are near-duplicates. This means that an LLM might also achieve a non-zero row completion rate by chance or prediction. Because of this complication, we manually judge the results in Table 2, given the results in Supplement Table 4, and the structure of the dataset.

Thankfully for our approach, it turns out that  GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (as well as other LLMs) have the remarkable property of regurgitating quite long and complex strings from their training data. For example, GPT-4 is able to generate *the entire Iris dataset*, consisting of 151 rows, given only the first couple of rows as prompt. Thus, while there are few cases of ambiguity (marked as question marks in Table 2), the evidence of memorization is usually fairly clear (and conversely, there are the cases where the model gets the dataset's content completely wrong).

To better illustrate the nature of our memorization tests, we have created additional Figures depicting the qualitative test results: https://github.com/colm365/code/blob/main/memorization_tests.pdf. The figures illustrate the Leveshtein string distance between the model response and the actual content in the dataset. For the different tests, we depict two cases, one where there is evidence of memorization and one where there is no evidence of memorization.

We would like to highlight that the anonymous code repository contains a Python package that can perform all the memorization tests (and the package can also print the prompts).

[Reviewer_odGz]: Thanks for the interesting response. The reference to Oswald et al. 2023 would have helped me lot, to understand the general background of this work.

Regarding the memorization tests, I am still not entirely happy. Could you give some more details as to how you defined ""memorization"" quantitatively? Or is Table 2 obtained from ""eyeballing""/manually checking the test battery results?

Your explanation on the adult dataset suggests that memorization is not a binary thing, but that LLMs sometimes seem to memorize particular parts of a dataset.  This is an interesting observation, but it is not discussed in the paper if I am not mistaken. What would be the consequences of ""partial memorization""? Do you think that it differs from ""full memorization""?

[Authors]: Thanks for your response!

Although the memorization tests lead to quantitative results, such as the number of rows that were correctly completed, we don't define memorization quantitatively.

Our notion of memorization follows the approach outlined in a series of papers on memorization in LLMs, most importantly Carlini et al. 2019 https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08232 and Carlini et al. 2021 https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07805.

Following this literature, we say a text is memorized if a model can consistently generate it.

Of course, this makes sense only for texts that contain sufficient entropy so that the probability of generating the text by chance or prediction is close to zero.

In our context of tabular datasets, we rely on the fact that these datasets contain random variables: It is impossible to consistently reproduce the realizations of random variables unless the values of the random variables have been seen before (i.e., during pre-training). 

For example, the OpenML Diabetes dataset contains an individual's glucose level, blood pressure, and BMI, as well as other measurements that are at least in part random. Now, if an LLM can consistently generate entire rows of this dataset, this is evidence of memorization. We note that this approach has been lightly formalized in the two papers referenced above, where the authors use the term ""canary.""

In judging memorization, one has to consider the completion rate of the LLM and the amount of entropy in the dataset. To give another example, the Iris dataset contains many rows that are near-duplicates. This means that an LLM might also achieve a non-zero row completion rate by chance or prediction. Because of this complication, we manually judge the results in Table 2, given the results in Supplement Table 4, and the structure of the dataset.

Thankfully for our approach, it turns out that  GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (as well as other LLMs) have the remarkable property of regurgitating quite long and complex strings from their training data. For example, GPT-4 is able to generate *the entire Iris dataset*, consisting of 151 rows, given only the first couple of rows as prompt. Thus, while there are few cases of ambiguity (marked as question marks in Table 2), the evidence of memorization is usually fairly clear (and conversely, there are the cases where the model gets the dataset's content completely wrong).

[Authors]: Dear reviewer t4Kc,

Thank you for your comments and questions. We believe there may have been some misunderstandings regarding our previous rebuttal responses. To clarify, we have provided additional justifications below. Could you please kindly re-evaluate our method based on the replies?

> So, it can not be extended to real-world difficult tasks?

We are sorry for the misunderstanding. In the original rebuttal, we were trying to say that our method **focuses on** complex tasks that require tools and interactions but **""is limited in""** simple tasks (not “limited to”). That means our methods may not have obvious advantages on simple one-hop questions. However, it is suitable to real-world difficult tasks.

> How to improve it?

As mentioned in our previous reply, we provide clear guidance in Section 3.2 to simplify the construction process and minimize human effort. Also, we mentioned that it is not necessary to consider all possible scenarios when designing states, as shown by our Bash experiment. Finally, as mentioned in Section 6 of our paper, to further reduce human effort, we can access running trajectories from a StateFlow model, and employ another LLM to iteratively add or remove states to automate the process. 

> How to solve it?

As mentioned in our previous reply, our method actually improves the reasoning of LLMs and reduces tool parameter errors because the LLMs are instructed with specific instructions at each state, so that they can follow a single instruction at a time for more accurate and dedicated reply.

Thanks,

Authors

[Reviewer_t4Kc]: What is the difference between “be limited in” and “be limited to”? I think it’s the same thing:) 
I would like us to stop dwelling on grammar and return to the questions in the paper. Does your response mean that your method can be applied to complex tasks but is the simple part of complex tasks? Or does it mean it works but you didn't experiment? The current reply is too confusing for me to understand. Could you explain it again?


As for the second question, I think it is acceptable. Thank you for your clarification this time.


As for the third question, your reply is very different from the first one, which makes me very confused. How do you plan to solve it? Now what you say seems to be a bunch of formulaic words, could you explain it with an example, which will help me better understand it?

[Authors]: Thanks for your patience and allow us to clarify.

## Re 1st question:
1. Our method can solve complex tasks. That means solving the whole task.
2. We performed experiments on complex tasks. All the benchmarks we used are generally considered as complex benchmarks. They all require multiple steps and interactions with the environment.


## Re 3rd question:
**Example of a complex task (from ALFWorld, used in our experiment)**: Household setting: You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, …. Your task is to: heat some apple and put it in garbagecan

Note: to solve the task, we need to find the apple, heat it, and then put it garbagecan. During the process, the agent needs to interact with the environment, for example, go to a listed place and see if the apple is there. (Please refer to *Figure 10* in the Appendix for this example and solving process by our method)


**Your original point**: This framework primarily enhances process control and does not improve reasoning or subtask solving; therefore, common errors, such as tool parameter errors, still occur.

**Your question**: How do you plan to solve it?


**Our reply:**
1. Our framework **already improves** reasoning and subtask solving, as well as reducing tool parameter errors.  Let’s use the ALFWorld example above for illustration.

   - As noted, solving this task requires multi-steps, and the LLM needs to decide what to do next based on feedback from the environment. 
   - If you could take a look at Figure 4 in our paper, our method decomposes the process to different states. Within each state, a specific instruction is used to prompt the model. For example, In the “Pick” state, only instructions related to picking up the object are sent to LLM.
   - Compared to using one instruction that asks the model to perform all actions, we only ask the model to perform one action in a state. So the LLM can follow the instructions better, and we expect less common errors.

2. To further improve reasoning, iterative refining methods can be easily added to our framework. 
	- For example, *Reflexion* learns from past errors to improve reasoning, and we show that adding Reflexion can improve the performance with less incurred costs (See results in Figure 5).

> Pairwise Baselines  

PairS leverages the transitivity assumption of LLMs, which gives it a natural efficiency advantage. Win-rate and ELO aggregation methods are designed to handle systems or players with non-constant performance, making them more effective at dealing with changes. However, in our case, we are ranking the exact same aspect of constant response candidates, which means sorting-based algorithms that exploit transitivity have inherent benefits.

---
> Ranking as evaluation is not motivated  

To support our motivation claim in Sec 3.1, we conducted a complementary experiment using 50 randomly sampled summary candidate pairs for each source text in SummEval. We calculated the 3-way agreement rate accuracy between direct scoring and human scores, as well as between pairwise comparisons and human scores. The results consistently show that pairwise comparisons have better agreement with human judgements than scoring, across all three selected LLMs.
|Model|Scoring|Pairwise|
|-|-|-|
|Mistral-7B|38.7|45.5|
|Llama2-7B|39.6|43.0|
|GPT-3.5| 42.3|48.1|

Moreover, ranking-based evaluation has already been successfully employed in various real-world applications, such as re-rankers for data selection, output reordering, and recommendation systems.

---
> PairS may be expensive  

More discussion about the cost of pointwise methods, such as G-Eval.   
G-Eval uses a weighted average of 20 inference repetitions, resulting in total computations of 20N. In comparison, PairS-greedy requires Nlog2(N) in the worst case. Specifically, for the 16-candidate SummEval example mentioned above, the factor is only 2.5N.

If you compared M systems for N pairs, wouldn’t the computational complexity be O(M^2 * N^2)? Can N pairs be sampled from M systems and can offer the same level of ranking quality as that for 2 systems? I think this point is not discussed or clarified in the paper.

> G-Eval uses a weighted average of 20 inference repetitions
Thank you for sharing the additional experiment. 

The G-Eval paper called the API multiple times because the GPT API does not return token probababilities. The method uses the weighted average of tokens (e.g., 1-5) based on their probabilities, which can be computed by a single inference. Below is the description from the G-Eval paper.

```
For GPT-4, as it does not support the output of token probabilities, we set ‘n = 20, temperature = 1, top p = 1’ to sample 20 times to estimate the token probabilities.
```

Thanks for clarifying. Then, I believe Section 2 is misleading and the point should be further clarified. This is rather a presentation issue and I don't have any follow-up questions."

Thank you for sharing the additional experiment. 

The G-Eval paper called the API multiple times because the GPT API does not return token probababilities. The method uses the weighted average of tokens (e.g., 1-5) based on their probabilities, which can be computed by a single inference. Below is the description from the G-Eval paper.

```
For GPT-4, as it does not support the output of token probabilities, we set ‘n = 20, temperature = 1, top p = 1’ to sample 20 times to estimate the token probabilities.
```

Thanks for clarifying. Then, I believe Section 2 is misleading and the point should be further clarified. This is rather a presentation issue and I don't have any follow-up questions.

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for the feedback and have addressed them below.


1. Pairwise Baselines

This ablation study with other two pairwise baselines using a different format than our result Table 1. In this table, 50, 100, 240(max) represents the number of randomly selected candidate pairs used to calculate the win rate or the ELO rankings. For SummEval dataset, there are 16 candidates for each datapoint, resulting in a total of 240 pairs. (N^2, including swapped comparisons and excluding self-comparison.) 

For PairS-Greedy, we cannot control the exact number of comparisons needed for the ranking. By averaging the results over 10 repetitions, we use 39.2 and 44.3 comparisons to achieve the global rankings for Mistral-7B and GPT-3.5.
When using calibrated PairS-Greedy, (where each comparison uses the average probabilities of pairwise comparison with permutated positions), the number of comparisons are 41.5*2 and 46.3*2. The reason we mention calibrated result is that the 240 total comparison pairs include comparisons with swapped positions. 

Both uncalibrated and calibrated PairS-Greedy, our method are significantly more efficient than the win rate and ELO baselines. Presenting these results in a table may not be optimal, and we plan to use line figures in the formal revision to better illustrate the findings.

2. Ranking as evaluation is not motivated  

> If you compared M systems for N pairs, wouldn’t the computational complexity be O(M^2 * N^2)?

We believe the reviewer has misunderstood the setup of pairwise ranking. **We are not comparing the whole LLM systems, but a list of candidates.** The candidates can be generated by different systems, but we only evaluate the quality of those candidates. If we have M candidates to rank, we can sample up to M*2-M pairs. What we meant by ""as the number of candidates is typically much larger than the number of score categories"", is M is usually larger than the scale of score categories (5 for likert scale). Therefore, providing the ranking of M candidates is more fine-grain than scoring.

---
3. pointwise evaluation and G-Eval

We acknowledge the statement in G-Eval paper. We believe the reason why G-Eval cannot handle API model efficiently is beyond the discussion of our paper. In our paper, what we claim is pointwise evaluation methods generally have complexity of O(N) and our argument is still hold: pointwise evaluations can only gain marginal performance with more computations.

---
In conclusion, we believe our experiments and ablation studies provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed PairS method. We have compared with multiple baselines including both pointwise and pairwise evaluation methods. Our results show that PairS is more efficient and effective than pairwise baselines and achieves higher human agreement than both pointwise and pairwise baselines. 

Furthermore, we have clarified and provided explicit support for the motivation behind ranking evaluation. We also have address reviewer's misunderstanding regarding our discussion of the limitation of direct scoring in Section 2. 

We have made a sincere effort to respond to the reviewer's concerns and to provide additional evidence and clarifications to support our claims. In light of our response, we respectfully request that the reviewer consider improving their score, as we believe our work makes a valuable contribution to the field of LLM evaluator."

I have adjusted my score accordingly. I encourage the authors to incorporate these discussions into the next version. One last comment: If I remember correctly, Xie et al. studied both correct and false contexts. Perhaps the authors should verify this and include the differences in the next version.

[Authors]: Thank you for considering the rebuttal and changing your score. We will improve the revision and include the discussed points.
We also re-checked Xie et al.'s work and would like to elaborate on the difference between ours and their work:

We refer to single-source experiments (§4.1 in Xie et al.) when we say they studied coherent yet false contexts.
In these experiments, Xie et al. provide a ""counter-memory"" context which they synthetically generate to contradict the model's knowledge.
Our setting is also single-source, but the contexts are real and factually true, hence we claim our setting is more realistic.

Xie et al. also have multi-source evidence experiments (§4.2).
These experiments contain, as you rightly point out, ""both correct and false contexts"".
Their multi-source experiments focus on ""the evidence preference of LLMs"", while we focus on knowledge-updating behavior.
Their experiments show LLMs exhibit a *confirmation bias* - they often prefer evidence supporting their parametric knowledge.

Our realistic single-source experiments extend their findings. We show that real documents meant to update knowledge can unintentionally bias the model toward its wrong parametric answer (our section 4.3.1). This can be framed as a confirmation bias of sorts, which we term ""parametric bias"". The parametric bias describes the case when models fail to update their knowledge even if the evidence is **not** supporting the parametric knowledge but just includes the parametric answer.
We will add this distinction to the paper.

Overall I understand why this work matters in the constrained setting of ""parametric is wrong but retrieved is right"", but it is often very hard to make these assumptions for retrieval-augmented LMs at inference time due to the potential noise/irrelevance of retrieval. In addition, the analysis often focuses on the most unlikely scenarios (<5%, points 2 and 3 in the review): the authors acknowledge that analysis could be expanded to more prevalent scenarios in knowledge conflicts instead of the fringe cases (""We'll also add an analysis of the 𝑈𝑖 cases to the revision""), but I'm not sure if this is entirely within the scope of camera ready revision.

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for the response. We would like to expand a bit on some of the points mentioned by the reviewer.
>it is often very hard to make these assumptions for retrieval-augmented LMs at inference time due to the potential noise/irrelevance of retrieval

The assumption of ""parametric is wrong but retrieved is right"" does indeed define the scope of applicability of our findings. However, ensuring correct model behavior in this setting is a **necessary** step if the goal is to ensure factual correctness using RAG. Ensuring relevance and quality of the retrieved documents is another, complementary step. **Both** of these steps are necessary for the final goal of factually correct outputs.

>In addition, the analysis often focuses on the most unlikely scenarios (<5%, points 2 and 3 in the review)

We think this is an important disagreement point and would like to explain our thinking and observations. We hope this provides more insight into why we focus on the R subset.

Frequency is not the sole factor in determining the importance of a problem. For example, adversarial attacks rarely happen in practice, yet there is substantial research to ensure adversarial robustness of models. Analogously, the R subset may appear to be a ""fringe case"", but it is a well-defined problem for which we provide a deeper analysis.
Out of all incorrect open-book answers, the R subset contains only the ones which did not change at all after introducing the context. This specificity, together with our analysis is what makes it actionable.

Ui subset, however, includes all other incorrect answer categories ""lumped"" together.
If you look into the Ui subset, it is not one ""prevalent scenario"", but rather many of them:
We manually classify 100 samples in 𝑈𝑖 for the Mixtral on NQ:
- 42 incorrect answer format
- 10 model answer is also correct, but != GT
- 13 model answer is correct while the GT is incorrect
- 12 model being bad at reading tables
- 13 incorrect reading (prediction appears in context, but != GT)
- 4 answers not from context
- 5 model wrongly claims the answer is not in the context
- 3 context is illegible

Analysing the Ui subset, as proposed by the reviewer, would actually require separating each sub-category. This would turn each of them into actionable, but small subsets, similar to R.

>the authors acknowledge that analysis could be expanded to more prevalent scenarios

We would like to clarify that we intended to add to the revision the manual analysis above for the Ui subset, together with the provided motivation for focusing on the seemingly smaller but actionable R subset."

[Reviewer_bvQZ]: After reading the author responses to all reviews, I am somewhat convinced by their answer to my concern. 

| this category of errors contributes to a larger fraction of errors overall

The authors address this with two observations:
1. The category of errors where the model updates to a different incorrect answer is also a fragmented category. Explaining any such update would also require explanations for relatively small fractions of errors
2. They report a semantic matching metric (instead of EM) which further highlights that the ""retention"" errors are higher than initially estimated.

[Reviewer_2iuH]: I would like to thank the authors for the detailed response. Overall I understand why this work matters in the constrained setting of ""parametric is wrong but retrieved is right"", but it is often very hard to make these assumptions for retrieval-augmented LMs at inference time due to the potential noise/irrelevance of retrieval. In addition, the analysis often focuses on the most unlikely scenarios (<5%, points 2 and 3 in the review): the authors acknowledge that analysis could be expanded to more prevalent scenarios in knowledge conflicts instead of the fringe cases (""We'll also add an analysis of the 𝑈𝑖 cases to the revision""), but I'm not sure if this is entirely within the scope of camera ready revision.

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for the response. We would like to expand a bit on some of the points mentioned by the reviewer.
>it is often very hard to make these assumptions for retrieval-augmented LMs at inference time due to the potential noise/irrelevance of retrieval

The assumption of ""parametric is wrong but retrieved is right"" does indeed define the scope of applicability of our findings. However, ensuring correct model behavior in this setting is a **necessary** step if the goal is to ensure factual correctness using RAG. Ensuring relevance and quality of the retrieved documents is another, complementary step. **Both** of these steps are necessary for the final goal of factually correct outputs.

>In addition, the analysis often focuses on the most unlikely scenarios (<5%, points 2 and 3 in the review)

We think this is an important disagreement point and would like to explain our thinking and observations. We hope this provides more insight into why we focus on the R subset.

Frequency is not the sole factor in determining the importance of a problem. For example, adversarial attacks rarely happen in practice, yet there is substantial research to ensure adversarial robustness of models. Analogously, the R subset may appear to be a ""fringe case"", but it is a well-defined problem for which we provide a deeper analysis.
Out of all incorrect open-book answers, the R subset contains only the ones which did not change at all after introducing the context. This specificity, together with our analysis is what makes it actionable.

Ui subset, however, includes all other incorrect answer categories ""lumped"" together.
If you look into the Ui subset, it is not one ""prevalent scenario"", but rather many of them:
We manually classify 100 samples in 𝑈𝑖 for the Mixtral on NQ:
- 42 incorrect answer format
- 10 model answer is also correct, but != GT
- 13 model answer is correct while the GT is incorrect
- 12 model being bad at reading tables
- 13 incorrect reading (prediction appears in context, but != GT)
- 4 answers not from context
- 5 model wrongly claims the answer is not in the context
- 3 context is illegible

Analysing the Ui subset, as proposed by the reviewer, would actually require separating each sub-category. This would turn each of them into actionable, but small subsets, similar to R.

>the authors acknowledge that analysis could be expanded to more prevalent scenarios

We would like to clarify that we intended to add to the revision the manual analysis above for the Ui subset, together with the provided motivation for focusing on the seemingly smaller but actionable R subset."

[Reviewer_y1YK]: Sincerely thank you for the detailed response. I have adjusted my score accordingly. I encourage the authors to incorporate these discussions into the next version. One last comment: If I remember correctly, Xie et al. studied both correct and false contexts. Perhaps the authors should verify this and include the differences in the next version.

[Authors]: Thank you for considering the rebuttal and changing your score. We will improve the revision and include the discussed points.
We also re-checked Xie et al.'s work and would like to elaborate on the difference between ours and their work:

We refer to single-source experiments (§4.1 in Xie et al.) when we say they studied coherent yet false contexts.
In these experiments, Xie et al. provide a ""counter-memory"" context which they synthetically generate to contradict the model's knowledge.
Our setting is also single-source, but the contexts are real and factually true, hence we claim our setting is more realistic.

Xie et al. also have multi-source evidence experiments (§4.2).
These experiments contain, as you rightly point out, ""both correct and false contexts"".
Their multi-source experiments focus on ""the evidence preference of LLMs"", while we focus on knowledge-updating behavior.
Their experiments show LLMs exhibit a *confirmation bias* - they often prefer evidence supporting their parametric knowledge.

Our realistic single-source experiments extend their findings. We show that real documents meant to update knowledge can unintentionally bias the model toward its wrong parametric answer (our section 4.3.1). This can be framed as a confirmation bias of sorts, which we term ""parametric bias"". The parametric bias describes the case when models fail to update their knowledge even if the evidence is **not** supporting the parametric knowledge but just includes the parametric answer.
We will add this distinction to the paper.

[Reviewer_y1YK]: Thank you for your prompt and detailed explanation. I have no further questions. Looking forward to the revision."

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer oJ7q,

Thank you for your follow-up questions.

> In the motivation, the goal seems to select data for mathematical reasoning.

We'd like to emphasize our goal: exploiting influential data on **a wide range** of data sources (**both reasoning and general data**) for mathematical reasoning. We will make a clearer statement in our future updates.

> Here the only difference is that if the math data is selected by QaDS. But turns out using QaDS in this case is worse.

We share ideas from two aspects to your concern:

* As we mentioned in our previous response, there exists a common law that **mathematical reasoning consistently improves with increasing reasoning data amount** [1]. There is a **large** decrease of ~1.7M reasoning data from QaDS-*S_{large}*-4.3M to QaDS-*S_{large}*-2.6M, and thus it is reasonable to see a performance drop (from 44.2% to 42.6%), which is not caused by our strategy. However, with a decrease of ~0.3M general data from QaDS-*S_{large}*-5.0M to QaDS-*S_{large}*-4.7M, our QaDS successfully selects influential general data and achieves performance gains (from 45.6% to 48.8%), showing the effectiveness of our QaDS.

**Kindly Note**: We show paper ""Table 2"" below for your convenience.

|   Task    | *S_{large}*-4.3M | *S_{large}*-5.0M | *S_{large}*-2.6M | *S_{large}*-3.0M | *S_{large}*-4.7M |

* When coming to the comparison with a fixed data size, our QaDS **significantly surpasses** random strategy, and reaches an improvement of 6.6% in paper ""Figure 3"" (48.8% vs 42.2%) in *S_{large}*-4.7M.

In summary, our QaDS can be applied on a wide range of data (**not limited on reasoning data**) and exploit most influential data.

[Authors]: These files in the linked repository show the ablation results where the number of documents in each month bucket are reduced. To be specific, rather than considering the 5000 most edited topics, we repeat the setup described in the paper instead with the x most edited topics. We plot those averages for LLaMA, RedPajamas, and OLMo. Note that when x=5000, this is the same result as in the paper (Figure 4).

We find that for x>50, the effective cutoffs of the three models is consistent with the full results. x=50 is the threshold where the trends and effective cutoffs are less consistent with the original results due to the more apparent variability when taking few samples. Ultimately, we find that these extra results are a useful addition to the paper and confirm our main hypotheses for reasonable number of document bucket sizes.

We hope that you've had a chance to read our response. We would really appreciate a reply to let us know if our response and clarifications have addressed the issues raised in your review, or if there is anything else we can address.

Sincerely,

Authors

[Reviewer_upBC]: Thank you for the detailed response. 

Q1) I see. Would be great if you can clarify this in the paper as well.

Q2) Thank you for the clarification. I see an issue here where certain samples were dropped because chatGPT did not do well on them. To me, this is what happened: ""we have a test set and some examples are problematic to ChatGPT so we are going to remove them and consider the remaining samples as our new test set"". Perhaps, this would work if all the models are of the same family, but comparing with the baselines (which are very competitive even after subsampling) would not be fair. 

You address this point in ""response to W1 of Reviewer qkT2"" which is very important and in fact, I think that's how your main experiment should be. This should make the separation between classification (the typical verification task) experiment and explanation experiment much clearer. In the classification experiments below, the baseline BERT outperforms the other methods including yours except when Llama-2 is used. Conditioning the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the use of one specific language model is problematic. 

IMO, a much stronger case for your paper would be either: 
1) propose InstructAV as a data collection method where you show that using the selected samples, fine-tuned models will result in better performance. This way, you are not claiming a new method and therefore don't have to explain why one language model performs better than the other.  Or, 
2) Have a stronger separation between classification only and clarification with explanation. I would suggest splitting the experiments (and table 2) into two parts: Classification where you show the performance on ALL the test samples like you did in the response below, and Classification+Explanation on the selected samples where you compare only with methods that provide explanation. In step two, you can justify the drop in performance when other language models by offering an explanation to the results. In Authorship Analysis, it is a well-known phenomena that explainable methods have lower performance and SOTA methods are harder to explain (especially to the layman person).  

Q3 & W1.1) Thank you. This is clear from the results, but why? is it because of the model size? or the characteristics of the model? If I want to use your method with another model, how do I choose that model? just the biggest model available? I am interested in more than describing what the table shows. 

[Q4 & W1.2] That's a strong claim. You cannot infer that without sharing descriptive stats of the data, e.g. avg length in words for example. 

[W2: ChatGPT can correctly determine the label, it can also provide a possible explanation.] I respectfully disagree. Please let me clarify that for authorship analysis tasks ""humans"" do not do well compared to computational approaches. (see Stamatatos  99, for example). Therefore, when you generate an explanation such as ""uses passive voice"", or ""passionate about the topic"" or some generic explanation, humans would tend to agree unless such note is completely wrong. What matters more in authorship analysis is the frequency of such features. What I was trying to say that, human evaluation in your case is a high-level check that whatever ChatGPT generated is actually in the text but not more than that. It is very different from the typical ""human evaluation"" for other tasks. Even BERTScore, it is just showing that similar models generated similar text and that on its own has its problems.

[Reviewer_upBC]: Dear authors, 

Thank you for the response. I did read your reply to my comments and to the other reviewers' as well. I believe that the experiment on 1000 examples (response qkT2 below) is very important AND is the correct setup to conduct the experiments. It also shows that with this setup similar observations about the performance of baselines and proposed methods still hold.
 
Additionally, I think that most of the issues can be solved either by rewording and making careful claims (specifically about human evaluation being the ground truth), and some doable reorganization of the experimental sections (if you choose to do so).  

Finally, please consider the comments that I've provided about clarity above.

[Authors]: Thank you for your detailed comments.

**[Q1]**

Yes, we will include these details in the updated paper.

**[Q2]**

Thank you for your suggestions. In the updated paper, we will adopt your recommendation to divide the classification and Classification+Explanation sections into two parts. For the classification section, we will use the new test set without discarding any samples. For the Classification+Explanation section, we will use the previously selected samples and provide additional explanations.

**[Q3 & W1.1]**

The performance of InstructAV fine-tuning is correlated with the capabilities of the base model. These capabilities are influenced by factors such as the model size, the size and quality of the pretraining corpus. For instance, we employed 7B models for both LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-1, but LLaMA-2 performed better due to being trained on more tokens and having longer context lengths. Therefore, if we choose a base model with a larger size and a more extensive pretraining corpus, we can expect better performance.

**[Q4 & W1.2]**

Thank you for your insightful comment. I appreciate your perspective and the opportunity to clarify our approach. We understand your point that computational approaches often outperform humans in authorship analysis tasks, as evidenced by works such as Stamatatos (1999). Our intent in using human evaluation was indeed to perform a high-level check to ensure that the explanations generated by ChatGPT were coherent and aligned with the content of the text, rather than to serve as a comprehensive evaluation of authorship features. Specifically, our primary goal was to verify that these explanations were sensible and relevant to the texts being analyzed.
We acknowledge that frequency and other nuanced features play a crucial role in authorship analysis, which computational methods are better suited to capture. As per your earlier comments, a more suitable human evaluation study would involve asking humans to generate explanations on why two texts are written by the same author, which could then serve as a gold standard for comparison with ChatGPT's responses. However, such a study would be very expensive to conduct and might have its own issues, given that humans do not perform well on writing-style analysis tasks.
Given these limitations and constraints, we considered ChatGPT-generated explanations to be a reasonable and cost-effective alternative; minimally, we have verified that the explanations generated by ChatGPT were coherent and aligned with the text content.

In our updated paper, we will make these distinctions clearer and provide more context around the purpose and scope of our human evaluations. We will also highlight the limitations of our approach and elaborate on the role of computational methods in capturing the finer details of authorship features.

[Reviewer_GRur]: The potential risk of data leakage is not discussed. The data might have been included in the LLMs' training corpus. I wonder if there are some tests showing the data memorization possibilities and how the authors address the potential data contamination problem.

[Authors]: Thank you for your reply and comment.

To investigate potential data contamination, we conducted 0-shot, 2-shot, 4-shot, and 8-shot tests on each dataset using the original, un-tuned LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-1-7B, and OPT-6.7B models. Each experiment was performed three times, and the average results are presented below:

| |Model | IMDB | Twitter | Yelp |
|----|----|----|----|----|
0-shot |LLaMA-1-7B | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000
| | OPT-6.7B | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000
| |LLaMA-2-7B | 0.006 | 0.010 | 0.021
2-shot |LLaMA-1-7B | 0.189 | 0.097 | 0.226
| | OPT-6.7B | 0.258 | 0.179 | 0.297
| |LLaMA-2-7B | 0.309 | 0.336 | 0.397
4-shot  |LLaMA-1-7B | 0.014 | 0.020 | 0.127
| | OPT-6.7B | 0.191 | 0.220 | 0.217
| |LLaMA-2-7B | 0.279 | 0.350 | 0.375
8-shot |LLaMA-1-7B | 0.003 | 0.007 | 0.002
| | OPT-6.7B | 0.005 | 0.008 | 0.003
| |LLaMA-2-7B | 0.020 | 0.033 | 0.025

The results indicate that the original models struggle to perform AV tests effectively on our dataset, especially in the 0-shot setting where the outputs are highly random. Both LLaMA-1-7B and OPT-6.7B failed to make correct judgments, and LLaMA-2-7B showed weak judgment capabilities. The best performance was observed with the 2-shot models, which could produce outputs following the template format, ""The correct answer is yes/no...[Analysis]."" However, even when the format was correct, the accuracy was still very low, with the best result (LLaMA-2 on the Yelp dataset) being lower than a random guess. Consequently, we postulate that it is unlikely that our dataset was included in the training data of the original models.

Sincerely,

[Reviewer_upBC]: Thank you for the detailed response. 

Q1) I see. Would be great if you can clarify this in the paper as well.

Q2) Thank you for the clarification. I see an issue here where certain samples were dropped because chatGPT did not do well on them. To me, this is what happened: ""we have a test set and some examples are problematic to ChatGPT so we are going to remove them and consider the remaining samples as our new test set"". Perhaps, this would work if all the models are of the same family, but comparing with the baselines (which are very competitive even after subsampling) would not be fair. 

You address this point in ""response to W1 of Reviewer qkT2"" which is very important and in fact, I think that's how your main experiment should be. This should make the separation between classification (the typical verification task) experiment and explanation experiment much clearer. In the classification experiments below, the baseline BERT outperforms the other methods including yours except when Llama-2 is used. Conditioning the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the use of one specific language model is problematic.

[Reviewer_nfpB]: Thank you for answering my questions and taking the time to add the additional 7B results; I thought this paper was very strong to begin with, and that opinion has not changed with the rebuttal - I will definitely be pushing for acceptance at this time! 

(Would definitely be great to run out the additional benchmarks for the final version though; just as a way to make the paper even stronger).

[Authors]: Thank you so much for the appreciation and support of our work! 

Here are the results on GQA ( it takes longer than expected to add GQA results with some bug fixes). We will continue exploring additional benchmarks to show the effectiveness of our method.

[Reviewer_hNTR]: Thank you for your detailed response. The result does look great if that is the official `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`. Additionally, it is confusing that the instruction-tuned model achieved a lower accuracy (0.6569) compared to the base model (0.6589). Would it be more appropriate for the authors to evaluate chat-based benchmarks for chat models, such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval? (I am happy with current benchmark setup.

I have not changed my score but my overall confidence this paper has been reinforced by your response. Below are a couple of questions which I'd be interested in.. Responses could be added to the paper but more likely suitable for a followup paper.

- **Effect of multiple expert iteration steps**: I understand that further expert iterations had unwanted side effects. In the appendix you only report the sample efficiency of 0 and 2 steps. How quickly does it degrade at 3 or 4 steps? Also, what are these numbers 57.7 to 52.9? This is not reflected in Table 8. Quantifying this in greater detail would enable future research which could improve on this which in turn would strengthen the contribution this paper. 
- **Computational costs**: It is clear that it's cheaper to run inference on a smaller LLM, but how would this compare to the costs of building the InfoSumm system? Conducting the expert iteration + generating the datasets over multiple rounds has non-trivial computational costs. It might not be straight forward to calculate costs, but reporting the flops or GPU hours would be insightful for replication and comparison in practical settings.
- **Dataset size**: The response does not elaborate on the size of the generated datasets. Could a larger dataset be generated? Is there a relationship between the filter-rate and the number of samples? Furthermore, is it possible to imagine generating datasets of this size to other domains? This would help promote future work in this (very interesting) research direction.

Errors in the paper
- At second to last paragraph in section 3 Appendix E.4 is referenced. I think it was meant to be E.3? ""algorithm to efficiently search for high-quality samples. See Appendix E.4 for additional ablation results that focus on distilled model performance."".

[Authors]: Again we appreciate the thoughtful comments! The degradation of number (from 57.7 to 52.9) is measured through MSTTR (mean segmented token type ratio), representing lexical diversity of each dataset. We note that the degradation in MSTTR was not reported in the original version of the paper, and will include this in the revised version of the section.

We agree that adopting our framework to other domains and tasks is an exciting and open research direction! While different domains may require different critics and objectives for expert iteration, some recent works on human alignment propose to self-train models without relying on human supervision (e.g. using self-evaluation capability of LLMs [1]). We are particularly excited to see if our framework extends to reasoning tasks where verification is critical.

Regarding the dataset size (and accordingly the cost), the relationship between rejection sampling and the number of samples is quantified by the sampling efficiency throughout the paper. In our experiments, we generated 4.5M resulting samples with aggregated sampling efficiency of 58.5%. (We will specify the associated computational costs in the revised version of the paper.) While we did not scale up beyond this level as 4.5M samples sufficed to compete with the strong baselines, larger dataset can be generated by (1) simply running the pipeline more, or (2) increasing sampling efficiency, e.g. by lowering filtering rate. While in this work the filtering thresholds were considered as hyperparameters and were chosen through manual inspection of the outputs, an interesting future direction is to analyze the tradeoff between the precision and recall of synthetic data, and to explore the limit of synthetic data scale (e.g., what happens when we fine-tune on 100M pairs of summarization data?).

Lastly, the reference to Appendix E.4 was intended — while in Appendix E.3 we evaluate sampling efficiency across expert iteration steps, in Appendix E.4 we compare the resulting model performance with and without expert iteration. We will clarity this in the revised version!

- I understood in practice there may not be summaries available. However, I think the test set you are using contains image summary pairs. I want a baseline here to better understand how hard the task is and how I interpreted these numbers.

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for their suggestion of further baselines. As also suggested by Reviewer dJXX, we performed a more quantitative evaluation of the query-based observation retrieval task, which we describe in the corresponding response. 

As suggested, we then also studied a comparison using the term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf) on the proposal abstract, given the set of 10 benchmark queries. We found the following scores, for the average relevance (True or False) of the top 10 retrieved observations:
**Base CLIP model:** 0.38
**Fine-tuned CLIP model:** 0.77
**tf-idf-based retrieval:** 0.82

We note that the relatively high retrieval score of tf-idf is not very surprising, since the retrieved abstracts are likely to contain the queried terms and thus will be flagged as positively associated by the evaluator LLM. Nevertheless, it is a useful baseline to put the accuracy of CLIP models in context. We emphasize again that the main motivation for our method is to enable querying unlabeled datasets, where each image does not necessarily have a corresponding descriptive caption.

[Reviewer_5XaM]: Thanks for the results. If we think of tf-idf-based retrieval as oracle, the result here actually shows that fine-tuned CLIP model is a very strong method."

Below I've shared some of my other concerns: 

My main concern is that the experiments do not necessarily support how the model will be used in practice. Figure 1 is misleading because it suggests the downstream task is ""observation retrieval"" with phrases. However, there is no quantitative evaluation for this experiment. The qualitative evaluation is not sufficient. 

In Section 4.2, you have the following sentence: 
```
We emphasize that for scientific usefulness, the goal is not necessarily to
correctly retrieve the most relevant objects, but rather to identify a diverse set of interesting
candidates for manual follow-up and further analysis.
```
Even in the qualitative evaluation, the success criteria are not well defined. What does it mean for the candidate to be ""interesting""? This is pretty vague.

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for considering our response and raising the score. As suggested, we will highlight the motivation in the Introduction when revising the paper.

**Quantitative evaluation of query-based retrieval task**

To address the further concern of only showing qualitative evaluation for the “observation retrieval” task, we performed a quantitative evaluation of the relevance of retrieved images using the CLIP model. We designed the following prompt, used alongside Outlines to constrain the generated output to be boolean. This lets us evaluate whether the abstract corresponding to a retrieved observation is relevant or not.

```py
@outlines.prompt
def prompt_fn(abstract, query):
     """"""[INST]
You are an expert astrophysicist, with broad expertise across observational and theoretical astrophysics.

Abstract: ""{{abstract}}""
Query: ""{{query}}""

The above is an abstract for a proposed observation taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (labeled ""Abstract""), and an object or concept (labeled ""Query"").

Could the observations corresponding to the abstract contain the query? Be precise, and do not contain related concepts or objects. 

Your response should be either True or False. Only return True if the query is closely related to the abstract, and the downstream observation could be relevant to the query.
[/INST]
""""""
```

We then evaluated this prompt, for the base as well as fine-tuned models, on the top 10 closest images by cosine similarity returned for 10 different queries: [""globular cluster"", ""dwarf galaxy"", ""SN1987A"", ""strong lensing"", ""galaxy clusters"", ""interstellar medium"", ""dark matter"", ""spiral galaxies"", ""lyman alpha"", ""comets""]. We used the Mixtral-0.1-Instruct open-weights model utilized elsewhere in the paper.

We obtained the following results for the average fraction of relevant images:
- **Base CLIP model:** 0.38
- **Fine-tuned CLIP model:** 0.77

The fine-tuned model is thus significantly more likely to return images relevant to the query. We note that this test is still heuristic – as noted in the paper, the captions are noisy, and thus a “relevant” observation could be retrieved with a generic abstract (an example being Proposal 11956 in Tab. 4 of the paper). Nevertheless, this is a useful result to include in the revised paper, and we thank the reviewer for the suggestion.

**What does it mean for the candidate to be ""interesting""?**

By ""interesting"", we mean that the retrieved images should be meaningfully related to the query, with the goal of guiding further inquiry. This is similar to e.g. searches in the space of materials or biomolecules, where relevant candidates can be identified with AI models and flagged for further domain-informed investigation. Figure 3 (left) provides quantitative evidence for this -- the fine-tuned model shows a clear separation in the distribution of cosine similarities between truly associated image-text pairs (solid red line) and randomly shuffled pairs (dashed red line), unlike the base model, highlighting its ability to surface relevant observations.

[Reviewer_dJXX]: Thank you for the additional results. They show that the fine-tuned CLIP model is better than the base CLIP. This is a positive result. 

I do have some more clarification questions: 
1. The experiment setup is still not super clear to me. What is the input and the output? How does it relate to the downstream task in Figure 1? From what I can see in Figure 1, there is no need for Mixtral model or an abstract in the observation retrieval task.
2. What is this dataset? Is this a new dataset? 
3. This is minor. From your reply, it seems that ""a diverse set of interesting candidates"" still means correctly retrieving relevant candidates. The sentence ""We emphasize that for scientific usefulness, the goal is not necessarily to correctly retrieve the most relevant objects, but rather to identify a diverse set of interesting candidates for manual follow-up and further analysis."" makes it sound like you are getting ""diverse"" objects rather than relevant objects. 

I agree with all the reviewers that this is a great extension of an existing technique to a new domain. I would be okay if the work was accepted to the conference.

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of the paper, and recommending acceptance to the conference. We would be grateful if an updated score could reflect this new assessment.

1. We are happy to further clarify the experiment, which closely follows the observation retrieval task in Fig. 1. We embed each of the 10 queries (these are the inputs) mentioned in the original reply using the text encoder, and retrieve the 10 most similar observations from the validation set by cosine embedding. We then prompt Mixtral by asking whether the associated abstract is relevant to the input query or not (with boolean output 1 or 0), and the quoted result is an average of this number over the 10 queries. The reviewer is correct that an external LLM is not needed for the retrieval task; however, in this case, it is used to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved observation by treating the (in this case available) associated abstract as the “ground truth”. This is done since there is no objectively correct evaluation in this case. This is closely related to LLM-based evaluations performed in some NLP benchmark tasks, when there isn’t an objectively correct answer.
2. The dataset in this case is the same (validation) dataset used in the paper.
3. We agree with the reviewer that this could be made clearer in the paper. By “diverse” candidates, here we simply mean that there may be many relevant observations retrieved, each interesting in its own way, without a fixed criterion. For example, when querying for a scientific use case (e.g., interstellar chemistry), observations containing many different types of objects (e.g., the interstellar medium, supernovae) could be retrieved, each being interesting and relevant. We will clarify this further in the revised paper."

**Quantitative evaluation of query-based retrieval task**

To address the further concern of only showing qualitative evaluation for the “observation retrieval” task, we performed a quantitative evaluation of the relevance of retrieved images using the CLIP model. We designed the following prompt, used alongside Outlines to constrain the generated output to be boolean. This lets us evaluate whether the abstract corresponding to a retrieved observation is relevant or not.

```py
@outlines.prompt
def prompt_fn(abstract, query):
     """"""[INST]
You are an expert astrophysicist, with broad expertise across observational and theoretical astrophysics.

Abstract: ""{{abstract}}""
Query: ""{{query}}""

The above is an abstract for a proposed observation taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (labeled ""Abstract""), and an object or concept (labeled ""Query"").

Could the observations corresponding to the abstract contain the query? Be precise, and do not contain related concepts or objects. 

Your response should be either True or False. Only return True if the query is closely related to the abstract, and the downstream observation could be relevant to the query.
[/INST]
""""""
```

We then evaluated this prompt, for the base as well as fine-tuned models, on the top 10 closest images by cosine similarity returned for 10 different queries: [""globular cluster"", ""dwarf galaxy"", ""SN1987A"", ""strong lensing"", ""galaxy clusters"", ""interstellar medium"", ""dark matter"", ""spiral galaxies"", ""lyman alpha"", ""comets""]. We used the Mixtral-0.1-Instruct open-weights model utilized elsewhere in the paper.

We obtained the following results for the average fraction of relevant images:
- **Base CLIP model:** 0.38
- **Fine-tuned CLIP model:** 0.77

The fine-tuned model is thus significantly more likely to return images relevant to the query. We note that this test is still heuristic – as noted in the paper, the captions are noisy, and thus a “relevant” observation could be retrieved with a generic abstract (an example being Proposal 11956 in Tab. 4 of the paper). Nevertheless, this is a useful result to include in the revised paper, and we thank the reviewer for the suggestion.

**What does it mean for the candidate to be ""interesting""?**

By ""interesting"", we mean that the retrieved images should be meaningfully related to the query, with the goal of guiding further inquiry. This is similar to e.g. searches in the space of materials or biomolecules, where relevant candidates can be identified with AI models and flagged for further domain-informed investigation. Figure 3 (left) provides quantitative evidence for this -- the fine-tuned model shows a clear separation in the distribution of cosine similarities between truly associated image-text pairs (solid red line) and randomly shuffled pairs (dashed red line), unlike the base model, highlighting its ability to surface relevant observations.

[Reviewer_dJXX]: Thank you for the additional results. They show that the fine-tuned CLIP model is better than the base CLIP. This is a positive result. 

I do have some more clarification questions: 
1. The experiment setup is still not super clear to me. What is the input and the output? How does it relate to the downstream task in Figure 1? From what I can see in Figure 1, there is no need for Mixtral model or an abstract in the observation retrieval task.
2. What is this dataset? Is this a new dataset? 
3. This is minor. From your reply, it seems that ""a diverse set of interesting candidates"" still means correctly retrieving relevant candidates. The sentence ""We emphasize that for scientific usefulness, the goal is not necessarily to correctly retrieve the most relevant objects, but rather to identify a diverse set of interesting candidates for manual follow-up and further analysis."" makes it sound like you are getting ""diverse"" objects rather than relevant objects. 

I agree with all the reviewers that this is a great extension of an existing technique to a new domain. I would be okay if the work was accepted to the conference.

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of the paper, and recommending acceptance to the conference. We would be grateful if an updated score could reflect this new assessment.

1. We are happy to further clarify the experiment, which closely follows the observation retrieval task in Fig. 1. We embed each of the 10 queries (these are the inputs) mentioned in the original reply using the text encoder, and retrieve the 10 most similar observations from the validation set by cosine embedding. We then prompt Mixtral by asking whether the associated abstract is relevant to the input query or not (with boolean output 1 or 0), and the quoted result is an average of this number over the 10 queries. The reviewer is correct that an external LLM is not needed for the retrieval task; however, in this case, it is used to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved observation by treating the (in this case available) associated abstract as the “ground truth”. This is done since there is no objectively correct evaluation in this case. This is closely related to LLM-based evaluations performed in some NLP benchmark tasks, when there isn’t an objectively correct answer.
2. The dataset in this case is the same (validation) dataset used in the paper.
3. We agree with the reviewer that this could be made clearer in the paper. By “diverse” candidates, here we simply mean that there may be many relevant observations retrieved, each interesting in its own way, without a fixed criterion. For example, when querying for a scientific use case (e.g., interstellar chemistry), observations containing many different types of objects (e.g., the interstellar medium, supernovae) could be retrieved, each being interesting and relevant. We will clarify this further in the revised paper."

[Reviewer_5XaM]: Text similarity baseline:
- I understood in practice there may not be summaries available. However, I think the test set you are using contains image summary pairs. I want a baseline here to better understand how hard the task is and how I interpreted these numbers.

[Authors]: We thank the reviewer for their suggestion of further baselines. As also suggested by Reviewer dJXX, we performed a more quantitative evaluation of the query-based observation retrieval task, which we describe in the corresponding response. 

As suggested, we then also studied a comparison using the term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf) on the proposal abstract, given the set of 10 benchmark queries. We found the following scores, for the average relevance (True or False) of the top 10 retrieved observations:
**Base CLIP model:** 0.38
**Fine-tuned CLIP model:** 0.77
**tf-idf-based retrieval:** 0.82

We note that the relatively high retrieval score of tf-idf is not very surprising, since the retrieved abstracts are likely to contain the queried terms and thus will be flagged as positively associated by the evaluator LLM. Nevertheless, it is a useful baseline to put the accuracy of CLIP models in context. We emphasize again that the main motivation for our method is to enable querying unlabeled datasets, where each image does not necessarily have a corresponding descriptive caption.

[Reviewer_5XaM]: Thanks for the results. If we think of tf-idf-based retrieval as oracle, the result here actually shows that fine-tuned CLIP model is a very strong method."

[Reviewer_Uywh]: Thank you for the response. The idea behind image cropping is clear to me now. If each image is seen multiple times during training in this way, would that affect the chance of retrieving 'a correct item'? Is that also the case in the validation set? I think the authors should explicitly address in the paper that they do not use different datasets for validation and testing. I know that cosine similarity is symmetric, but it is not clear to me how the ranks are also symmetric in this setup. I think Section 3.3 should contain more clarifications. Is |V| the same for the number of images and the number of captions?"

[Reviewer_7NpS]: Thanks for your response. I am still a little confused what 'domain' means in your context. Are you saying that you conceptualize the Transformer as a function from prompt to output? So I guess this would make the domain the space $vocab^{prompt_length}$. But then you limit the domain for a particular case by counting the domain as e.g. the number of facts in the prompt, or similar? In any case, it would be really helpful to have a formal definition of 'domain' in the paper, as this concept is critical to the paper.

Please can you clarify:
- p4: Why is the token of the query `John`? why isn't it `?`?
- p4: ""Notice that the number $N$ of input tokens is a small multiple of the domain size of the functions."" Why is this important? Not referred to in the rest of the paper.
- p5: ""Faye supplies the token strings associated with function f — say, the value of f applied to 0 is 3, etc."" What goes into the etc.? All of the values of f from 0 to n-1?
- p9: CoT [needs a] prompt of length $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ - is this correct? is it the same $N$ as on p4?

In any case, it would be really helpful to have a formal definition of 'domain' in the paper, as this concept is critical to the paper.

Thanks for asking us to clarify this.  Our paper shows that, when the prompt involves the definition of one or two functions, plus a particular query, eg, 
“the value of the function at 0 is 3, … , the value of the function at 9 is 2, what is the value of the function applied to the result of the function applied to 3?”
then a Transformer layer is likely to hallucinate.  We denote by N the number of tokens in the prompt of the Transformer (in this case $N$ is about 110), and by $n$ the size of the domain of the function defined by the prompt (in this case n is 10).  Obviously, $N=O(n)$ and $n=O(N)$.
We hope this clarifies the issue.


> p4: Why is the token of the query John? why isn't it ??

Thanks for pointing this typo out. The token of the query is “?” or potentially an EOS token. We will make the correction in the paper.


> p4: ""Notice that the number of input tokens is a small multiple of the domain size of the functions."" Why is this important? Not referred to in the rest of the paper.

It is not important.  It means that, for the rest of this argument, we can use $n$ and $N$ interchangeably without harm to the asymptotic behavior.

> p5: ""Faye supplies the token strings associated with function f — say, the value of f applied to 0 is 3, etc."" What goes into the etc.? All of the values of f from 0 to n-1?

Yes.

> p9: CoT [needs a] prompt of length $\sqrt{N}$  - is this correct? Is it the same N as on p4?

CoT generates a sequence of reasoning steps before outputting the answer. Theorem 2 proves that CoT needs to generate at least $\sqrt{N}$ reasoning steps to solve iterated function composition. This is the same $N$ as p4.

I'm still at the same point with my scores. The major question for me is: is it enough to say that there are various scenarios where prior work doesn't hold, or are detailed delineations of cases where we minimize/maximize entropy required?

[Authors]: We appreciate your response and engagement.

The short answer to your question is: it depends on the data and model used. The longer answer is: For different architectures and datasets, models memorize different shortcuts to solve the task by focusing on an overly narrow/wide context, which leads to bias. The optimal beta mitigates this bias by modulating the model’s attention entropy."

The results show that attention entropy modulation (*i.e.* maximization or minimization) does not lead to substantial degradation on the downstream tasks used, while improving the performance in certain cases.
More specifically, attention entropy minimization leads to better performance on ARC, HellaSwag, TruthfulQA, GSM8K, and Winogrande; while attention entropy maximization improves performance on GSM8K and Winogrande. We will add these results to the manuscript, and we thank the reviewer for the constructive suggestion.

[Authors]: We also obtained the results for the in-processing baseline suggested by the reviewer: MABLE. Our results show that MABLE consistently improves fairness, and its effect is amplified when combined with our proposed post-processing method: EAT. The results are averaged over 5 seeds and use demographic parity as the gender fairness metric.

[Reviewer_vM14]: Thank you for the response. I appreciate the comments. 
I'm still at the same point with my scores. The major question for me is: is it enough to say that there are various scenarios where prior work doesn't hold, or are detailed delineations of cases where we minimize/maximize entropy required?

[Authors]: We appreciate your response and engagement.

The short answer to your question is: it depends on the data and model used. The longer answer is: For different architectures and datasets, models memorize different shortcuts to solve the task by focusing on an overly narrow/wide context, which leads to bias. The optimal beta mitigates this bias by modulating the model’s attention entropy."

Missing thread of work.
1. We appreciate the reviewer's suggestions regarding interesting aspects of LLM-based reasoning. However, we have already reviewed a substantial number of recent papers and believe that incorporating the reviewer's suggestions would expand the scope of our survey beyond its intended focus.
2. We have reviewed very recent studies up to March 2024 (the month of submission) and have reported various findings for advanced models such as GPT-4, PaLM 2, and Claude 2. Additionally, we consistently specify which LLM was utilized in each respective study.

Regarding the reviewer’s more specific comments:
1. The reversal curse indicates that models struggle to capture a basic symmetry property of the identity relation, instead learning a more superficial, unidirectional relationship. As noted by the authors, this is “a basic failure of logical deduction in the LLM’s training process”, which could extend to other relationships that are essential for effective reasoning such as “logical implications [...], spatial relationships [...], or n-place relations.” (see Section 1 and 4.1 of [Berglund et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.12288))
2. The mentioned paragraph relates to the previous sentence discussing the work of [Dziri et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.18654).
3. The term ""goal misgeneralization"" is used by [McKenzie et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.09479) and by us in the same context as defined in reference [[4]](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.01790). Could the reviewer please provide further clarification?
4. The limited number of tasks in [McKenzie et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.09479) does not invalidate the authors' finding that LLMs replicate certain types of human-like logical errors present in their training data."

> The reversal curse indicates that models struggle to capture a basic symmetry property of the identity relation, instead learning a more superficial, unidirectional relationship. As noted by the authors, this is “a basic failure of logical deduction in the LLM’s training process”, which could extend to other relationships that are essential for effective reasoning such as “logical implications [...], spatial relationships [...], or n-place relations.” (see Section 1 and 4.1 of Berglund et al. 2024)

I disagree. The reversal curse does not happen in context: models are perfectly capably of inferring ""Joe Biden is US president"" when **prompted** with ""US president is Joe Biden""; reversing relations like this is not a problem. They just struggle to do that during in-weights learning. This suggests it's a failure of knowledge storage/retrieval (when a ""A is B"" is stored in one direction, models fail to retrieve A when conditioned on B) not of logical deduction. 

The first passage you cited is a hypothetical that is debunked two sentences later: ""Moreover, this is not explained by the LLM not understanding logical deduction."" The second cited passage is also a question, not a claim.

> The limited number of tasks in McKenzie et al. (2023) does not invalidate the authors' finding that LLMs replicate certain types of human-like logical errors present in their training data.

They *sometimes* replicate human errors. I think asserting this without a ""sometimes"" is a claim the McKenzie et al. don't provide sufficient evidence for.

> The term ""goal misgeneralization"" is used by McKenzie et al. (2023) and by us in the same context as defined in reference [4]. Could the reviewer please provide further clarification?

You're right!

[Authors]: We appreciate the reviewer’s engaging discussion on the reversal curse.

This phenomenon can be addressed from two perspectives: knowledge retrieval/storage or logical deduction. While we agree that the in-context learning experiments of [Berglund et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.12288) suggest that the reversal curse might stem from a failure of information retrieval, we respectfully disagree that this phenomena is unrelated to the model’s reasoning. As noted by the authors, while attributing the reversal curse solely to logical deduction may be considered ""a simplification,"" it remains a ""useful"" perspective to relate it to deductive reasoning. Specifically, the reversal curse illustrates “a basic inability [of LLMs] to generalize beyond the training data” (see Section 1), which will have a significant impact on their reasoning behavior.

[Reviewer_AG6y]: Thanks for the response. Let's agree to disagree then! I think it's perfectly fine to present an interpretation of the reversal curse as a reasoning failure in the paper, but it should be clear it's a novel interpretation put forth by the authors of the present paper and it should be supported by some arguments.

> Specifically, the reversal curse illustrates “a basic inability [of LLMs] to generalize beyond the training data” (see Section 1), which will have a significant impact on their reasoning behavior.

I agree it will impact reasoning behavior but IMHO it's not justified to call it a reasoning failure. If a model training data cutoff is 2023, the model won't be able to reason about the gold and silver medalists of 2024 Summer Olympics. But we wouldn't call that a reasoning failure, would we?"

210,Tabular Transfer Learning via Prompting LLMs,Accept,6tsFJ9FxCS,,,,"[Reviewer_ijuV]: Your clarifications do help but some things are still not clear
1. The lr/knn baselines are still not super clear and I believe they have not been optimized to the fullest extent possible for transfer learning.
2. For unlabeled examples: can you provide an example of how it is used? e.g. let's say I have columns x,y,z and target column t. For unlabeled examples, column t is empty. So now you find the most correlated column to 't' amongst x,y, and z? If so, what is this column for the datasets being discussed? The presence of such a column in features does not seem like a very likely phenomenon.

[Authors]: **Further clarification: LR and kNN.**

First, we would like to clarify that we use all columns from the heterogeneous datasets for the LR and kNN. Specifically, by concatenating all columns in both datasets, the classifier trained on both the source and target dataset (as they will have the same input feature dimensions) can be applied to the few-shot target samples. All of the experiments in Table 3 assume that some sets of columns in the source and target datasets overlap, allowing a classifier that fits one dataset to make meaningful inferences on the other.

Nevertheless, to further alleviate your concern, we conducted an additional experiment using the suggested technique (i.e., FA [1]). However, such an adaptation technique also exhibited similar behavior (cf. Table 3), presumably because it is not helpful in the few-shot scenario, which is our main problem setting.

**Further clarification: Using unlabeled data as a transfer source.**

For further clarification, we provide an example from the Diabetes dataset, where the target task is to predict whether a patient is diabetic (i.e., the target column), and the input columns are Insulin, BMI, and Age. The unlabeled samples do not have a target column, so the pseudo-demonstration consists of insulin, BMI, and Age. For example, the pseudo-demonstration will be ‘Q: If BMI is 37.9, and Age is 21, what is Insulin level? A: 64’ (see Figure 1, and note that Insulin is most highly correlated with the target column Diabetes). Our intuition here is that knowledge of predicting Insulin levels from BMI and Age could be useful for predicting patients with Diabetes from Insulin, BMI, and Age (as these are highly related tasks).

**Reliability of the Classifier** Thanks a lot for adding the comparison between Mistral and Llama. The stark difference in classifier accuracy between Mistral and Llama highlights the difficulty in training reliable LLM-based answer extractor that works across models. I appreciate that solving this problem is out of scope for your paper, but I think it's important to emphasize this limitation in the paper. (e.g. in your reply, in the discussion of differences to Wang et al. you describe your approach as a solution, which seems too strong given the strong bias in this method.)

**Difference to Wang et al.** I'm not sure what solution your paper provides that the paper from Wang et al. doesn't. If I understand correctly, that paper also trains a classifier. Can you be more specific to what the solution is your paper provides but that paper doesn't?

[Authors]: Thank you for your comments and further questions!

**Reliability**
Thank you for your suggestions. We agree it is important to address that our classifier may not perform perfectly on models that are significantly different.  If one wants to apply our classifier to their own models, we suggest inspecting the model's response first, and further finetuning the classifier if the response style is highly different from the training data, to further improve its robustness. Therefore, we will share our classifiers so that other people can continue improving them based on their results. We will include this in the final version of the paper.


**Solution to Wang et al.**
Sorry for causing any confusion. By ""solution"", we don't mean *""how to extract the text answer""*. The solution here means *""which one to choose when facing the choice between the first token and text answer evaluation"".*
Wang et al. showed the mismatch issue but didn't give a clear suggestion on which one is clearly better. **How much benefit do we get by doing text evaluation instead of first token probability evaluation?**
Given the mismatch problem shown by Wang et al, we want to know which one should we choose by comparing them systematically in terms of robustness and accuracy. In both cases, the text answer evaluation shows superior properties. Therefore, we provide an answer to the mismatch problem raised by Wang et al. 

We hope this can address your concern adequately. We are happy to give further explanations if there is still any uncertainty. If you find the revisions and clarifications satisfactory, we would appreciate your consideration in re-evaluating the manuscript.

[Reviewer_6RFZ]: Thank you for your response, the rebuttal has clarified some areas I was concerned about and I'll increase my score (and expect that a final version of the paper would also be clear about these).

204,Learning From Correctness Without Prompting Makes LLM Efficient Reasoner,Accept,njbZMZg2xc,,,,"[Authors]: We would be delighted to discuss any further questions or clarifications regarding our work. The following are some supplementary details.

---

**Comprehensive Experiments:**


We think our experiments are sufficient based on following facts: 1) we evaluated LeCo with different demonstrations (i.e. CoT and Complex), both of them confirming the effectiveness of LeCo; 2) we compared to popular baselines (i.e. SC, ADPSC) and learning-from-error methods (e.g. RCI). Your suggestion work, namely DUP, is published after the submission deadline of CoLM. Besides, we actually attempted other earlier works achieving predominant reasoning performance, such as PHP[4]  and CSV[5], but we did not report the scores. This is because we find these prompting-based methods are extremely sensitive. Adopting the same prompts in their works with the GPT API version we used, we cannot consistently reproduce their reported performance across several different runs.

On the other hand, we do not think LeCo is the same kind of work against the prompting-based methods. Although we both aim at improving the multi-step reasoning abilities, our method is a more labor-efficient, token-efficient, and transferable one. We did not need to dive ourselves into designing prompts when encountering a new task or using a new API/model.

We admit that LeCo might underperform than the methods using elaborated prompts in some scenarios. We still would like to highlight the superiority of LeCo on transferability and cost-saving.

**Confidence:**

Following  [1], our method also employs confidence measures based on logits, which have demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing generation quality.

We consider a step is incorrect according to the following perspectives: 1) Calculation errors, 2) Exaggeration of reasoning conditions, and 3) Fabrication of non-existent information. Our experimental results indicate that 65% of incorrect reasoning steps correspond to those with the lowest confidence levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm.

**Model Capacity:**

It is widely recognized that the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) play a crucial role in their performance across various tasks. For example, studies [2,6,7] use LLM evaluation to refine original solutions, making it challenging to conduct such evaluations on open-source models.

**Step 7 in the algorithm:**

LeCo first finds the earliest error step, then considers all previous steps as correctness and splices them into the last reply. Figure 1 shows this process; For instance, if an error occurs in step 2, the next-round reasoning will start at step 2 with the identified correct steps unchanged.

**Preliminary experiments:**

To demonstrate “2) These initial heading tokens were also the most likely to change across different program runs.”, we present 2  partial solutions of the same question with different seeds.

> Q: Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. How many girls are not in the girl scout?

> A1:  Step 2: The number of boys is 2/5 * 200 = 80. Step 3: The number of girls is 200 - 80 = 120. Step 4: Now, let's find the number of girls in the girl scout.

> A2:  Step 2: If 2/5 of the students are boys, then there are 2/5 * 200 = 80 boys. Step 3: The remaining students are girls, so there are 200 - 80 = 120 girls. Step 4: If 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, then there are 2/3 * 120 = 80 girls in the girl scout.

It’s easy to notice that these initial heading tokens were also the most likely to change across different program runs.

**About Q1,Q3 and Q6:**

For Q1, thanks for pointing out the typo, we will revise the starting index.

For Q3, we would like to clarify that the figure represents the score distribution. The sample set used in early stop LeCo is drawn from the test set to help determine the threshold. The remaining portion of the test set is then assessed based on this threshold, as explained in the Further Analysis section. The figure is plotted to demonstrate that the sample set is appropriate for determining the threshold since both the sample set and the test set exhibit similar distributions. We will add more detailed legends and annotations to Figure 3 for better clarity

For Q6, The markers represent comparisons with base CoT methods and Complex-CoT methods correspondingly.

146,How Far Are We from Intelligent Visual Deductive Reasoning?,Accept,GKVcu86tzv,,,,"[Reviewer_Hoxc]: **Limited number of examples:** While I understand that the qualitative probes are meant to showcase the specific blindspots in VLMs, the results are hardly compelling if the entire analysis of ""what are the blindspots"" is only based on these 3 examples. These results would be a lot more compelling if the trends were exhibited on a larger set of images (even 10 examples per difficulty level). For example, in Table 4, you show that getting descriptions of segmented images results in fewer hallucinations. However, this finding is based on only one example (M-Medium). If this trend was shown to hold consistently on even ten examples, I would find the results much more convincing.

**Motivation for abstract puzzles:** Based on the stated motivation, it seems like you are using visual IQ tests to jointly combine two evaluation axes (image distribution shift and deductive reasoning abilities). However, these two axes are very different to each other, and combining them into a single task does not make for a controlled test at all.

I think my main issue with this paper is that it is using an IQ test to evaluate a model, when I don't think this is an appropriate use case for these tests -- IQ tests were designed for humans, not VLMs, and they tell a very different story for VLMs than they do for humans.

[Authors]: Thank you for the additional comment. We address them in below.

**Limited Number of Examples**

Our intention was to highlight specific instances that reveal the models’ deficiencies in handling complex visual deductive reasoning tasks. Table 4 only serves as an illustrative case study, presenting three qualitative examples for demonstrating the blindspot. We agree that a broader set of examples would provide a more robust analysis, we have incorporated new results from the Raven subset (60 examples) to expand our figure 3, which shows the same conclusion that additional segmentation dramatically improve the perception of the VLMs:
| | Raven | Manual-easy | Manual-medium | Manual-hard |
|-----------|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Before Segmentation | 7.4 | 50 | 20 | 20 |
| After Segmentation | 21.2 | 80 | 60 | 30 |

We also tested many examples in the Mensa and IT datasets, which shows the same finding as well. We will add the results and additional analysis into our paper.

**Motivation for Abstract Visual Puzzles**

Your point about the decoupling of image distribution shift and deductive reasoning abilities is well taken. As we mentioned in our last comment, we would investigate these pattern-based reasoning tasks using naturalistic images. This will help us assess their performance with realistic objects which does not have data distribution shift. We will also investigate if instruction fine-tuning can help close the data distribution gap and enhance the VLM performance. These studies will help us gain more insights in whether data distribution shift is the culprit. However, they require more effort, making them beyond the scope of this paper, which focuses on identifying existing issues rather than meticulously tracing their origins.

Our goal was to simulate a more holistic challenge that mirrors scenarios where generalist VLMs must navigate through even unseen and unfamiliar scenarios. You questioned whether it is appropriate to use RPMs for VLM evaluation. Although the PRMs were designed for humans as what you pointed out, we think that RPM problems represent a fundamental type of visual-spatial reasoning that artificial intelligence systems, particularly those aimed at achieving general intelligence, should also be able to perform well on.

In fact, using RPMs to assess VLM is not rare. For instance, many general VLM benchmarks like MATHVISTA [1] and MMMU [2] uses RPMs problems to probe models’ reasoning and understanding ability of complex patterns. When GPT-4v came out, technical evaluation work like [3] also probed its performance on abstract patterns, especially the RPMs. Different from them, our work dives deep into scrutinizing the blindspot, and the underlying issues when VLMs deals with these abstract patterns, showing some potential directions for future improvement.

[Reviewer_Hoxc]: Thank you for the additional results. What does the first column (""Raven"") mean? is that also an accuracy score?

I do not personally like the use of RPM-style intelligence tests for evaluating VLM reasoning abilities (including in datasets like MathVista and MMMU). I'll quote [Melanie Mitchell](https://aiguide.substack.com/p/did-chatgpt-really-pass-graduate) here about what these intelligence benchmarks like MMLU tell us about ChatGPT:
> But does an AI system’s performance on an exam actually predict that it will exhibit skills in the real world?  Perhaps there is a correlation between how humans perform on tests and on their future skills in the real world, but that correlation has not been demonstrated for AI systems.

> For example, when a human succeeds in answering a test question such as the example on inventory given above, we assume that the human can then generalize this understanding to similar situations—the point of the test, after all, is to evaluate knowledge and skills that go beyond the wording of any specific question.  But is the same true for ChatGPT?

At the same time, I acknowledge your point that benchmarks like MMMU and MathVista do exist and are generally accepted in the community, so it would be unfair to penalize you too harshly for using similar RPM tests. I will raise my score to a 5, since my other concerns about the paper (especially that most of the qualitative analysis is only done on 3 examples) still stand.

[Authors]: Thanks for your comment!

Overall I like the idea of the framing of this work. Based on the rebuttal and the other reviews, I want to increase my score from 4 to 6. I am not fully convinced with the framing of the “action vector” and some parts of the experiments. I’ll add some quick thoughts below for further discussion for the future, but I do not expect the authors to respond before the rebuttal deadline. 

> - We do not agree that the proposed actions are called “next sentence embeddings” as they represent a cluster of sentences at a more abstract level. Consequently, the planning model does not perform “next sentence language modeling” for the same reason.
> - As discussed in Section 3.1, we posit that it is necessary to compute abstractions that correspond to common writing patterns. By nature, planning in natural language involves a form of abstraction to deal with the vast action space. As Figure 2 demonstrates and we discuss in Section 5.3, there is a tradeoff between the granularity of actions (and hence informativeness for generation) and the difficulty of predicting the correct action. In the case that two consecutive sentences are guided by the same action, the language model provides fine-grained control conditioned on previous words and sentences through attention.

- I partly agree with you and I would take back my original statement a bit. But I think the question still exists: starting (even clusters of) sentence representation roots the vector based on the sentence representation space. An alternative way is to purely learn this action as a latent variable model: P(a|x). That might result in a completely different representation space and still might be somewhat helpful. Another alternative is the PEER paper that specifies the editing actions: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11663. Regarding the “tradeoff between the granularity of actions (and hence informativeness for generation) and the difficulty of predicting the correct action”, this really boils down to a broader question: if the action is just “vague” and hard to model, then it’s unclear whether it is helpful or in which way it can help the LM.  

> We have tested your suggested alternative way of using a signal from the language model, namely in our ablation that encodes the entire context using GPT-2 at once rather than encoding each context sentence with a sentence transformer and then fused into one representation with a trained transformer. We observed that this yielded no improvement (see Table 2 second row and third paragraph of Section 3.2). We will state explicitly that this ablation uses GPT-2 in the final paper.

- That’s good! Sorry I somehow missed that part when writing the review.

[Authors]: We agree that it is preferable to have action representations that can evolve dynamically with the data. For this reason, we let action embeddings adapt when passing them to the LM. Nonetheless, we consider learning better actions from text as one of the top avenues for future work. Thank you for your suggestions in this regard."

I am not fully convinced with the framing of the “action vector” and some parts of the experiments. I’ll add some quick thoughts below for further discussion for the future, but I do not expect the authors to respond before the rebuttal deadline. 

> - We do not agree that the proposed actions are called “next sentence embeddings” as they represent a cluster of sentences at a more abstract level. Consequently, the planning model does not perform “next sentence language modeling” for the same reason.
> - As discussed in Section 3.1, we posit that it is necessary to compute abstractions that correspond to common writing patterns. By nature, planning in natural language involves a form of abstraction to deal with the vast action space. As Figure 2 demonstrates and we discuss in Section 5.3, there is a tradeoff between the granularity of actions (and hence informativeness for generation) and the difficulty of predicting the correct action. In the case that two consecutive sentences are guided by the same action, the language model provides fine-grained control conditioned on previous words and sentences through attention.

- I partly agree with you and I would take back my original statement a bit. But I think the question still exists: starting (even clusters of) sentence representation roots the vector based on the sentence representation space. An alternative way is to purely learn this action as a latent variable model: P(a|x). That might result in a completely different representation space and still might be somewhat helpful. Another alternative is the PEER paper that specifies the editing actions: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11663. Regarding the “tradeoff between the granularity of actions (and hence informativeness for generation) and the difficulty of predicting the correct action”, this really boils down to a broader question: if the action is just “vague” and hard to model, then it’s unclear whether it is helpful or in which way it can help the LM.  

> We have tested your suggested alternative way of using a signal from the language model, namely in our ablation that encodes the entire context using GPT-2 at once rather than encoding each context sentence with a sentence transformer and then fused into one representation with a trained transformer. We observed that this yielded no improvement (see Table 2 second row and third paragraph of Section 3.2). We will state explicitly that this ablation uses GPT-2 in the final paper.

- That’s good! Sorry I somehow missed that part when writing the review.

[Authors]: We agree that it is preferable to have action representations that can evolve dynamically with the data. For this reason, we let action embeddings adapt when passing them to the LM. Nonetheless, we consider learning better actions from text as one of the top avenues for future work. Thank you for your suggestions in this regard."

To follow up on the human evaluation -- some questions I had in my original review that still feel unanswered: 
""how many questions were evaluated by humans; what is the agreement between them; what is the performance on easy versus hard questions; etc.""

[Authors]: Thank you for the response!

The detailed human evaluation is summarized below. 31 RF questions and 30 DF questions were evaluated. Success rate (loose) is the main metric used in the paper, which allows partial string matching using edit-distance (discussed in Sec 2.3). The strict version requires exact string matching and is provided as a reference. The reasoning accuracy metric is discussed in Appendix A.6.

Humans generally achieve near-perfect success rates with no significant difference between easy and hard questions. The distinction between easy and hard questions lies in the need to reason about reversed edges (e.g., inferring ""b->west->a"" from ""a->east->b""), which is challenging for LLMs but straightforward for humans.

Imperfections in reasoning accuracy scores are due to: 1) the requirement for exact string matching, and 2) human errors in typing location names with special symbols.

Previously, different experts evaluated different questions, so a human agreement score wasn't available. Due to time constraints, a subset of the previously evaluated questions (10 RF, including 2 HARD, and 10 DF, including 3 HARD) were re-evaluated by different experts. Since DF and RF questions can have multiple valid solutions, the answers were not directly compared for agreement. Instead, the mean squared error (MSE) was computed for each metric across tasks and difficulty levels. For each file evaluated in both rounds, the squared error was calculated as (x₁ - x₂)² and then averaged by task type, difficulty, and metric type, as shown below. In general, MSE was low for both RF and DF questions in terms of our main metric.

[Reviewer_9ziQ]: I am clearly in the minority regarding whether the paper should be accepted or not, but I still don't understand the technical merit of the paper and its relevance to the conference. The only usage of an LM is to generate the training dataset, and the methods used such as triplet loss, and dual encoder methods are fairly standard practice in industry now. I am unfortunately still missing the significance of this work and can not raise the score.

95,MultiHop-RAG: Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Multi-Hop Queries,Accept,2VNDIE8spK,,,,"[Reviewer_rLY3]: I remain unconvinced by the authors' rebuttal. The novelty of this work is still unclear. The response does not adequately address the fundamental difference between this work and existing multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, aside from the retrieval data source. My initial question was not intended to suggest that Wikipedia should be the data source. Rather, I am concerned with the conceptual differences, particularly given that previous literature has also evaluated retrieval performance and generation accuracy of large language models. If the primary contribution of this work is the introduction of a different data source, then the claim of presenting ""the first multi-hop RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) dataset"" appears tenuous.

Regarding my second concern, the authors did not directly address why they did not evaluate using existing multi-hop reasoning baselines. The baselines I mentioned, along with several other widely used multi-hop reasoning methods(such as chain-of-note[1], react[2]), generate follow-up questions and use these questions to retrieve relevant documents before generating a final answer. This approach would seem to be more appropriate as a baseline for evaluating a multi-hop RAG dataset. The choice of data source should not preclude testing against these established methods.

In light of these points, I plan to maintain my score.

[Authors]: Thank you very much for your reply! We appreciate your academic professionalism and willingness to engage in this discussion. Below, we provide our response to each of your comments in this round of discussion.

**Q1. The novelty of this work compared to existing multi-hop reasoning benchmarks**

In addition to the retrieval data source, we have designed certain questions to assess the reliability of the target RAG systems, particularly in scenarios involving null queries. This type of question lacks a relevant context in the corpus, necessitating the LLM to identify and reject responses rather than make up a wrong answer. This is another important difference. Since LLM struggles to say ""I don’t know"" [1] and hallucinations exist in the RAG framework [2], it is important to measure the robustness of RAGs. Thus, our dataset proposes a comprehensive testbed for the RAG framework. 

**Q2. No evaluation of the advanced framework**

We appreciate your insight into the RAG framework and its role in our research. While focusing on dataset construction, we utilized a basic RAG framework to demonstrate the dataset’s potential. We are excited about the more complex frameworks, which could provide further insights, and have acknowledged this as a promising area for future research in the limitation section. And we're still exploring new methods. For your reference, we have tested the performance of advanced RAGs based on generating follow-up questions (query decompose) and using these questions to retrieve relevant documents. We also tested the Hybird search [3]. The baseline in the following table is the basic RAG framework, and the retriever is the best model tested in our work (bge-large-en-v1.5). Here are our results: 

|    mode   | chunk size | MRR@10 | MAP@10 | Hits@4 |
|:---------:|------------|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| baseline  | 512        | 0.4975 | 0.2447 | 0.6718 |

| decompose | 128        | 0.3884 | 0.1923 | 0.5188 |

It is evident that the advanced framework's performance on our datasets is suboptimal. As a result, we believe Multihop-RAG can be a useful resource for benchmarking advanced RAG technology, and we are available for further discussion if you have any additional questions or need more clarification.

[Authors]: Please allow us to further clarify a key difference between MultiHop-RAG and existing datasets such as HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHop. We acknowledge the existence of multihop QA datasets such as HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHop, among others. However, these existing datasets are not designed for the RAG task and do not include a retrieval step. The input used in these datasets is already provided with multiple pieces of evidence, and they primarily examine QA models' performance in multi-hop reasoning. Even if one extends HotpotQA to evaluate retrieval performance by combining the HotpotQA input data (Wikipedia text) as a corpus, this extension does not align with real-world RAG tasks. In real-world RAG scenarios, the dataset is usually internal or proprietary corpus, not a corpus used in LLM training such as Wikipedia. This is why we mentioned the Wikipedia data source issue in our previous response.

Our developed dataset, on the other hand, is specifically designed for the RAG task. It can be used to benchmark multi-evidence retrieval capability (given a question that requires multiple pieces of evidence, how to retrieve relevant pieces of evidence from a database) as well as multi-hop evidence generation capability. Our experiments find that an off-the-shelf RAG solution cannot effectively handle multi-evidence retrieval, which subsequently affects downstream generation performance. We believe the focus on the retrieval aspect sets us apart from existing datasets.

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer rLY3,

We appreciate your constructive feedback. As noted in our engagement, we believe there is a misunderstanding regarding the contribution of our work. We want to reiterate that our developed dataset is specifically for RAG tasks, which differs from previous multi-hop QA datasets that primarily focus on the multi-hop reasoning aspect while overlooking the multi-hop retrieval aspects. In addition to this major difference, there are also other outstanding differences, which we do not repeat here in the interest of your time.

If we clear up this misunderstanding, we believe this paper constitutes a valuable resource for benchmarking real-world RAG systems, as most of the human queries in RAG systems involve multi-hop, multi-evidence retrieval, and reasoning, as rightly recognized by other reviewers. We hope we have clarified this point and would appreciate it if you could reconsider your rating. Should you have any further questions, we are very happy to address them.

Were per-item correlations with GPT-4 or any other calculated?

[Authors]: Thanks for your insights!  Please allow us to further clarify about the quality control tests. 

First, the table in Q1 shows the difficulty distribution for each question type based on majority voting from crowdsourced annotations. The difficulty ranges from 1 (easiest) to 5 (most difficult). Scores below 3 are considered easy, while 3 and above are considered difficult. Temporal queries, which involve reasoning about time, are the most challenging for humans, followed by comparison queries that require making comparisons. Null queries, which have no answerable questions, are not evaluated and therefore excluded from this data. The results align with the model answer accuracy shown in Figure 3. As expected, the model exhibits the lowest accuracy on comparison and temporal queries, which are identified as the most difficult for humans. In contrast, the model achieves the highest accuracy on inference questions, which appear to be relatively easier based on the difficulty distribution.

Second, motivated by your comments, we reviewed the per-item correlations between human evaluators and model-generated responses. In our understanding, the per-item correlation you referred to may be the model's accuracy in answering each question compared to the human-annotated difficulty levels. If we have misunderstood, please correct us. Table 1 shows the accuracy of different models in answering the questions we used in human annotations. GPT-4 remains the best, followed by Google-PaLM. The results in Table 2 specifically analyze the questions the models answered incorrectly. For each model, the table shows the average difficulty scores of the questions it struggled with, as determined by human annotators. The 'nan' values indicate no incorrect questions. Thus, we can find that GPT-4 and PaLM can handle more challenging questions (failed on a high difficulty score), while open-source models struggle with simpler questions, as indicated by the average difficulty scores of their incorrectly answered questions in Table 2. This observation is consistent with the findings in Table 6 of the paper. Combining all the tables, we can clearly see how the difficulty of different types of questions varies for both humans and models. The stronger the model, the higher its accuracy in answering questions, and it can handle more challenging problems.

[Authors]: We understand your concern of comparing the model with existing LLMs and agree that a comprehensive report will be helpful. Note that in our paper we compare models with similar conditions (e.g. dataset, release dates), and report the numbers following the exact settings of public OpenLLM leaderboard as possible. We have more evaluation results to share here:

**Metrics using Open LLM leaderboard setting**

We have evaluated both models using the exact OpenLLM leaderboard settings as below, the numbers of several other models are referenced from the leaderboard.

| Model  | ARC-C | HellaSwag | MMLU | TruthfulQA| 
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Amber  | 41.89   | 71.63   | 30.76   | 34.00   |  
| Crystal |  47.01   | 71.97   | 48.78   | 35.91   |
| Llama1-7B | 50.94 | 77.80 | 35.67 | 34.34 |
| Llama2-7B | 53.07 | 77.74 | 43.80 | 38.98 | 
| Mistral-7B | 59.98 | 83.31 | 64.16 | 42.15 | 
| Gemma-7B | 61.09 | 82.20 | 64.56 | 44.79 | 
| Qwen1.5-7B | 54.18 | 78.51 | 61.97 | 51.08 |
| Codellama-7B | 39.93 | 60.80 | 31.12 | 37.82 | 
| OpenLlama-v2-7B | 43.69 | 72.20 | 41.29 | 35.54 | 
| Olmo-7B | 45.65 | 77.31 | 28.13 | 35.93 |
| Olmo-1.7-7B  | 49.4 | 78.68 | 53.52 | 35.89 |
| Falcon-7B | 47.87 | 78.13 | 27.79 | 34.36 |
| MPT-7B | 47.70 | 77.57 | 30.80 | 33.44 |
| RedPajama-Incite-7B | 46.25 | 71.63 | 27.68 | 33.03|

In comparison, Amber performs similar to open source models released around the same time (Falcon, MPT, Incite) with a slight advantage on MMLU but weaker in other metrics like ARC.

CrystalCoder, our newer model, is comparable with other models released around the same time (llama2, OpenLlama), where it shows a strong MMLU score of 48.78, as compared to Llama2’s 43.80. 

This field is advancing quickly, and newer models in the list, such as Gemma, Qwen1.5 and Olmo 1.7 are generally better.


**Other Metrics**

To evaluate our models on metrics on additional benchmarks, such as coding, we have conducted additional evaluations with newer version of LM-Harness and other benchmark suite (the exact evaluation settings will be available together with the evaluation code)

| Model  | Openbook QA  | RACE | BoolQ | PIQA | HumanEval p@1 | MBPP p@1  | Winogrande | GSM8K |

| Amber | 40 | 37.70 | 68.90 | 79.43 | - | - | 64.25 | - | 
| Crystal | 41.20 | 38.18 | 74.43 | 78.07 | 23.90 | 30.99 | 67.01 | 12.36 | 
| Llama2-7B | 44.20 | 39.52 | 78.07 | 78.78 | 13.05 | 20.09 | 69.38 | 14.71 | 
| Llama1-7B | 44.40 | 40.28 | 75.01 | 78.94 | 10.61 | 17.04 | 70.24 | 8.87 |

| Olmo-7B | 42.60 | 38.37 | 72.66 | 79.92 | 14.02 | 14.40 | 68.90 | 4.09 |
| Pythia-6.9B | 25.5 | - | 62.10 | 75.20 | 7.68 | 6.00 | - | - |
| Starcoder-13B | 32.80 | 32.15 | 63.91 | 65.72 | 30.70 | 37.56 | 54.30 | 9.02 | 
| Phi1.5 | 48.20 | 37.51 | 74.74 | 75.95 | 35.36 | 35.19 | 72.92 | 31.23 |



**Safety related metrics**

For instruct-tuned/chat models, the finetuned data can affect the model performance on tasks significantly. Here we provide a comparison on safety/biase of AmberChat, AmberSafe and a few reference models. 

| Model | Toxigen | BOLD Avg. | BOLD Race std. |
| -------- | ------- |  ------- | ------- | 
| AmberSafe | 2.0 | 0.51 | 0.092 | 
| AmberChat | 10.77 | 0.64 | 0.069 |
| Llama2-7B-Base | 21.28 | 0.304 | - |
| Llama2-7B-Chat | 0.01 | 0.482 | - | 
| Code Llama 7B | 22.64 | 0.230  | - | 
| Code Llama 7B Instruct | 0.04 | 0.503 | 0.042 |
| Falcon-7B-Base | 14.53 | 0.283 |  - | 
| Falcon-7B-Instruct | 5.78 | 0.332 | 0.035 |
| MPT-7B-Base | 22.32 | 0.32 | - |
| MPT-7B-instruct | 16.33 | 0.302 | - |

We found that safe tuning with DPO makes Amber less toxic, but not necessarily less biased. Specifically, the BOLD score (sentiment towards certain social groups) shows that AmberChat shows a better sentiment score over different social groups, and has a smaller standard deviation across groups (fair). 

Here, we only show the standard deviation across races, we have conducted more analysis and could include them in the revision. Compared with other models, AmberSafe shows good scores against a few open source models released around the same time. However, we can see that the Llama models, after tuning with their internal safety data, show a much safer behavior.  

Due to resource constraints, we prioritized comparing models with comparable settings and models released around the same time of our models, and avoided comparing with moving targets such as commercial APIs. Please let us know if there are specific results you would like to see.

[Authors]: Dear reviewer Lfw9,

   Thank you again for your review. Please let us know if we are able to address all your concerns.

[Reviewer_Lfw9]: Thanks for the responses!

My concerns have been partially addressed, but I still seek clarification on the term ""multifunctional."" Can the simple ReAct agent be considered multifunctional because it can plan, ground actions, and access KB? While the proposed framework appears advanced, it is challenging to comprehend the benefits the whole framework and part of it offers. I find the authors' explanation in the rebuttal is not convincing, as they merely provide a brief description without supporting figures or detailed elaborations. Furthermore, there seem to be many parts within the framework that require further investigation. As a result, I think the work as somewhat incomplete, and I would appreciate additional evidence and clarifications in the rebuttal and future iterations. Therefore, I maintain my score for now.

[Authors]: Dear reviewer,

By multifunctional, we mean explicitly multifunctional. React can be prompted with multifunctional examples, and hopefully the LLM will do whatever intended. However, there is no explicit control over the outputs and this problem presents even more challenge in hard tasks. ReAct demonstrates poor performance on demanding tasks, also noted by [1].

We include results on 2 very challenging tasks: crafter and Webshop. As shown in Table 2, AgentKit outperforms ReAct and AgentBench (which uses a similar prompt to react/reflexion).


[1] Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models


Finally, we note that our work is already at the page limit of this conference. We provide an easy-to-use and well-documented codebase, we leave further investigations to future works.

[Reviewer_Lfw9]: Thanks for the quick response!

The explanation has clarified the concept to some extent, but I still find it very challenging to grasp the effect of the modules within the framework. Given the complexity of this method, it's essential to clearly outline the motivation for incorporating specific modules and support this with comprehensive experiments that demonstrate their necessity. Unfortunately, this explanation does not achieve that clarity. This isn't an issue of page limits, as additional details could always be included in the appendix. I maintain my current score.

[Authors]: We ask that the reviewer consider instead the contribution of AgentKit as an easy-to-use toolkit for controlling LLM behavior through “thought-process”.

The framework itself is **very simple**: just graphs and nodes(prompts). See https://github.com/anonymousLLM/AgentKit

Although we showcase some complicated multifunctional agents with competitive performance on Crafter, AgentKit could be used to **build simple agents**. For example, the agent we built for Webshop only consists of a planner (appendix E.2).

[Reviewer_Lfw9]: I greatly appreciate the authors' efforts in developing an easy-to-use tool that works across various agent task types. However, ease of use from an engineering perspective does not necessarily imply that the effects of the modules and their comparison with other possible variants have been clearly explained. This clarity is crucial for a research paper. Overall, the paper is impressive, but it still lacks the fine-grained analysis needed to convincingly demonstrate that this is one of the optimal frameworks.

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer,

  Thanks for the quick response and continued engagement, and for raising this important concern. We hope to stress that our goal is to present AgentKit as a simple and general framework for **prompting** LLMs on agentic tasks. (AgentKit also demonstrates  a new perspective for creating LLM agents)

  To show **generalization**, we demonstrate SOTA performance through fair comparison in two very different and challenging tasks.
  To show **simplicity**, we offer a screenshot of the UI we developed to build agents without a single line of coding (in GitHub repo).
  To show **effectiveness** we compare to React, Act, and AgentBench(react/reflection style) and show superior performance on Webshop.

  We understand that the Crafter agent contains a lot of complicated features, we hope that the reviewer consider the contributions listed above independent from the hyper-parameter/module details of Crafter (since all the prompts have been released).

[Reviewer_Lfw9]: Thank you for the great response! I will raise my score, but I still hope that the authors could provide more fine-grained analysis about why the module design could produce better performance to fully convince the readers.

[Authors]: Dear reviewer,
 Thank you for actively engaging in the conversation, providing the insightful feedback, and raising your score in support of our contribution.
 We will address the omitted citations and include more experimental details in the final version about the modules for Crafter."

74,CTIKG: LLM-Powered Knowledge Graph Construction from Cyber Threat Intelligence,Accept,kBq842LK4k,,,,"[Reviewer_hhCn]: Thank you for your answer. I agree that the article presents some useful technical solutions to extract triples from those CTI articles, notably to overcome token length limitations (by storing intermediate results) and ensure the formatting is correct. But those solutions are variants of techniques that are already commonly used by LLM practictioners.
I still believe that the article does not pay enough attention to the cyber-security aspects of their work. As stated in the abstract, the goal is to build a *security-oriented knowledge graph"". There already exists dozens of such security-oriented KGs, many extrracted automatically through IE techniques (although not all LLM-based). Their purpose is often to allow for some automated reasoning and pattern discovery. To this end, it is often useful to define a priori the types of entities and relations one seeks to extract. In other words, for many applications of such KGs, restricting oneself to an ontology is often an advantage, not a limitation. I believe the article would benefit from a more thorough analysis of whether the extracted KG actually contain entities and relations that are useful and relevant from a cyber-security perspective.

[Authors]: We truly appreciate your feedback and comments.

## **Security-oriented Knowledge Graph**
Regarding the security-oriented knowledge graph, we have implemented the following designs to ensure the security orientation. We specified ""Only extract triples that are related to cyber attacks. If a sentence does not contain any triple about cyber attacks, skip the sentence and do not include it in your output"" and ""Focus on malware, Trojan horses, CVEs, or hacking organizations as the subjects of the triples'' in the prompts of LLM agents, and provided multiple security-related examples, such as ""[Leafminer, attempts to infiltrate, target networks]"" in the few-shot learning section of LLM agents. According to the evaluation results, CTIKG with these designs can be guided to focus on security-related entities and their relationships.

## **Related IE Approach**
Regarding related IE approaches, we compared CTIKG with Extractor, the SOTA non-LLM based IE approach specifically designed for cyber threat report text. In the evaluation, CTIKG outperforms it in both sentence triple extraction and article knowledge graph construction. For sentence triple extraction, CTIKG outperforms Extractor by about 9% in both precision and recall. For article knowledge graph construction, CTIKG outperforms Extractor by about 30% in both precision and recall.

## **Type of  Entity Relationship**

[Reviewer_hhCn]: Thank you for your answer. I agree that the article presents some useful technical solutions to extract triples from those CTI articles, notably to overcome token length limitations (by storing intermediate results) and ensure the formatting is correct. But those solutions are variants of techniques that are already commonly used by LLM practictioners.
I still believe that the article does not pay enough attention to the cyber-security aspects of their work. As stated in the abstract, the goal is to build a *security-oriented knowledge graph"". There already exists dozens of such security-oriented KGs, many extrracted automatically through IE techniques (although not all LLM-based). Their purpose is often to allow for some automated reasoning and pattern discovery. To this end, it is often useful to define a priori the types of entities and relations one seeks to extract. In other words, for many applications of such KGs, restricting oneself to an ontology is often an advantage, not a limitation. I believe the article would benefit from a more thorough analysis of whether the extracted KG actually contain entities and relations that are useful and relevant from a cyber-security perspective.

[Authors]: We truly appreciate your feedback and comments.

## **Security-oriented Knowledge Graph**
Regarding the security-oriented knowledge graph, we have implemented the following designs to ensure the security orientation. We specified ""Only extract triples that are related to cyber attacks. If a sentence does not contain any triple about cyber attacks, skip the sentence and do not include it in your output"" and ""Focus on malware, Trojan horses, CVEs, or hacking organizations as the subjects of the triples'' in the prompts of LLM agents, and provided multiple security-related examples, such as ""[Leafminer, attempts to infiltrate, target networks]"" in the few-shot learning section of LLM agents. According to the evaluation results, CTIKG with these designs can be guided to focus on security-related entities and their relationships.

## **Related IE Approach**
Regarding related IE approaches, we compared CTIKG with Extractor, the SOTA non-LLM based IE approach specifically designed for cyber threat report text. In the evaluation, CTIKG outperforms it in both sentence triple extraction and article knowledge graph construction. For sentence triple extraction, CTIKG outperforms Extractor by about 9% in both precision and recall. For article knowledge graph construction, CTIKG outperforms Extractor by about 30% in both precision and recall.

## **Type of  Entity Relationship**
Regarding the ontology of knowledge graph, first, the article sources are from different websites and authors. These authors have very different writing styles, and pose challenges for a fixed ontology to represent the entities and their relationships. To address this challenge, CTIKG adopts multiple agents to unify different writing styles and achieve better coreference resolution (such as the refiner on the triple level and the merger agent on the segment and article levels). Extractor, on the other hand, suffers from low precision due to this challenge. Second, non-security-related relationships between security-related entities also play an indispensable role for connecting correlated entities, such as two security-related entities like CVEs described in different sentences but connected via a non-security-related entity. In our Appendix case study, the similarity between CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2017-1188 was discovered based on the entity relationship of “for” and “memory corruption vulnerability”. Our further investigation revealed that Magniber and Cerber have a ""mutual ransomware payload"" relationship, and Emotet and Trickbot have a ""switch to"" relationship.
These entity relationships are determined by the author's writing style and cannot be anticipated in advance and defined in the ontology. We will include the effectiveness analysis of non-security-related relationships in the Appendix of the camera-ready version."

I understand that the main contributions lie in the new training procedure, and agree that the results on MMLU and long-context benchmarks are valuable. 

Re relu vs identity, I'm wondering whether having non-negativity is really necessary from the empirical perspective (because linear attentions are not strictly mimicking softmax attention anyway.

[Authors]: Thank you for your answer. We agree that adding more experiments with different kernel activation functions completes Table 3 nicely, strengthens the paper, and should answer your question. We uptrained combinations of kernel variants for 10B tokens from a pre-trained 1B parameters model:

The ""no embed"" models remove the additional fully connected layer that we added. Removing this layer significantly degrades the results. The ""1+elu"" models replace the ReLU activation with 
$f(x)=1+elu(x)$, as used in  [Transformers are RNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16236), which is simply a smooth version of the ReLU function. The ""no activation"" models do not use any activation function. The bias added by the fully connected layer of the kernel is important for producing good results. However, the activation itself has little impact on performance. That being said, the results are slightly better with a non-linear activation than without.

> 5. It would be interesting to try data-dependent decays proposed in Gated Linear Attention.

We actually tried this previously and noticed only a slight difference.
- 1B SUPRA; 10B RW tokens; HellaSwag = 57.0
- 1B GLA; 10B RW tokens; HellaSwag = 57.6

We believe the data dependent decay suffers from the same problem as fixed decay, which we mention in the paper (decays too fast and does not allow long context attention). We are continuing to look into this for future work, but this would require a thorough study of gating mechanisms and is out of the scope of this current work.

> 1. In table1, it seems that continual training for more tokens could bridge the gap between linear and softmax attention. 

As training is pushed from 20B tokens to 70B tokens, the results do improve (Table 1). They would probably improve further with even longer training. However, training for more tokens would bring the cost closer to pretraining. In our experiments, our approach seems most relevant in the context of uptraining with a modest compute budget. With more available compute, it is likely that other approaches such as Mamba would yield better results at lower cost and would therefore be preferable.

> 2. In table3, why do you only report the results of HellaSwag and ARC? Do you have a specific reason? What about other metrics?

For Table 3, we only considered 1B models for ablations. Since 1B models are weaker than the 7B models in Table 1, we opted to evaluate on easier test sets such as HellaSwag and ARC. Evaluating on a difficult set like MMLU would not be very meaningful because the results are just close to random guessing.

> 4. It would be interesting to use the attention distillation loss proposed in Hedgehog for learning the feature map?

Thank you for bringing this up! We were aware of the Hedgehog paper and in fact cited it in our related work. However, **there is no released code** beyond the pseudocode attached to the paper. This made it time-consuming to implement and test, but we agree that it is an interesting baseline and will try to include it in our camera ready version.

More specifically, a naive implementation of their approach would require two full computations of the attention matrices to compute the loss that the authors introduce. This is known to be memory intensive and we would not be able to train at scale with this approach without an involved implementation of memory efficient attention with an added attention loss.

Furthermore, in our Appendix, we show that our trained SUPRA matrices do not actually approximate the softmax matrices. The RetNet paper shows how the normalization of the attention factor that allows to approximate the softmax can lead to instabilities. When uptraining 1B models, we did experience these instabilities in practice. Thus, while we lack the experiments that would give a definitive answer to your question, we believe that the Hedgehog approach of trying to very closely approximate softmax may not be the correct approach for uptraining such linear models at scale.

Unfortunately, the Hedgehog paper does not publish evaluations on the common benchmarks like HellaSwag, ARC, and PIQA which does not allow a direct comparison of our respective results.


> 3. Could you release an anonymous huggingface repo for the 7B mamba model?

Yes, we plan to release our models and code together with this submission. For the 7B mamba, we have created an anonymous model on Hugging Face https://huggingface.co/mambacolm/mambacolm 


Thanks as well for including the missing references! We will include these in the final version of the paper.

[Reviewer_XQ7B]: Thank you for these results! I have two comments:

- 1B SUPRA vs. 1B GLA: Do you have any results beyond the HellaSwag dataset? I don’t consider a 0.6 difference to be slight.  It might be worth investigating whether training on more tokens offers an improvement over SUPRA's method with data-independent decays.

- Regarding Computational Resources: I understand the limitation regarding computational resources. However, since you were able to train the 7B Mamba model on 1T tokens as a baseline, it might be more fruitful to explore pushing this approach to its limits

[Authors]: Thank you for your interest and for your answer. We agree that a 0.6 difference is not insignificant and our further results below do suggest that GLA is indeed a stronger approach than the fixed decay used in SUPRA. It is worth studying further for long context and at larger scale but we believe this to be a broader study. 

|Model|Size|Tokens|HellaSwag|ARC-E|ARC-C|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|SUPRA|1B|(1.6T)+10B|57.0|62.4|31.6|
|SUPRA GLA|1B|(1.6T)+10B|57.6|64.3|33.1|

Additionally, we would like to share our perplexity evaluation as a function of context length to show why we believe that GLA improves the model overall but does not solve the long-context modeling capability issue of linear models. While showing a lower loss with GLA, linear model performance (including GLA) tend to plateau as the context is extended. 

|Model|8|32|128|256|512|1024|2048|

In your rebuttal to my fellow reviewer, you said ""In a structural sense, the original and reversal data have significantly different syntax, even if they have the same words, so that the model can learn to distinguish them easily.""

What if the language has free word order? Would that not violate your assumption that the original and reversal data have significantly different syntax, therefore the model would be able to implicitly learn a ""switch""?

[Authors]: Thank you for the response. We agree that the method should work with other languages to be practical. We assumed that most languages do have certain word ordering, so reverse text would be distinguishable by the model. However, if that’s impossible because the language has free word order (in the extreme case where reverse text is not distinguishable both syntactically and semantically, then the model might not need to switch), all we need to do is add a special token at the beginning of each reverse sequence fed to the model indicating that the sequence is in reverse order (normal sequences will have normal BOS token but no special token). This will help the model distinguish reverse sequences from normal ones at the very first token. Actually, we already do this in random-segment reversal with “[REV]” token (see Tab 2) because random-segment reversal is hard to distinguish from the normal sequences (we also use this token in the middle to indicate segment boundaries). Similarly, we can insert “[REV]” to the beginning of reversed sequences for the other types of reversals (token, word, entity-preserving) during training so the model will not be confused. We will add this discussion to the paper."

35,IsoBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Foundation Models on Isomorphic Representations,Accept,u8mWSBIkvw,,,,"[Reviewer_aqMK]: I thank the authors for their rebuttal. I have increased the score to 4 since the authors have done a decent job in arguing the contribution of the work. Specifically, I understand that the paper identifies the gap in the model’s understanding of an identical input when grounded in the image representation or the text representation. However, I believe that the paper and the rebuttal have not been able to justify the usefulness of the knowledge about this gap. In addition, I am not against the simplicity of the method, but I feel that the paper sufficiently shows its applicability for practical tasks. 


### **On implicit bias (and level of difficulty) of different modalities**

I agree that a chess board image or an ANL representation require LLM to comprehend piece positions and relationships, involving similar reasoning processes. However, I still feel that the task of comprehending the piece positions and relationships is easier in the text modality. Assume that the location of the rook in Figure 2 is d8 – this location is explicitly mentioned in the text representation by three dots before ‘r’. The text position encodings can easily tell that the location of the rook is 4th from the left. In addition, the text representation explicitly mentions the character ‘r’ that disambiguates the presence of the rook itself. 

### **Why IsoBench is useful for practitioners**

While the benchmark shows that there is a gap between image and text representations, we should also acknowledge that the tasks studied in the paper are more commonly grounded in the “image representation” instead of the “text representation”. For instance, I will not know the underlying mathematical function for the graphs shown in Figure 2, and will not be able to write the text representation (function form) to solve my queries. 

### **IsoCombination and IsoScratchPad are trivial and contrived**
I am fine with the triviality of the approach – it is okay if simple things work. However, the paper does not provide any guidelines on the scalability of the approach. The paper or the rebuttal does not tell me how to solve questions in SciBench or MathVista using IsoCombination. In practice, I will not be able to find an expert to write accurate text representation of the images.
In addition, I think image captioning is repackaged as IsoScratchPad. Infact, Section 3 argues that the “models only offer a coarse-grained representation that only summarizes high-level features, and may be unsuitable for detailed analysis such as plot and chart understanding.” and then ends up using the same models for image captioning (IsoScratchPad).

[Authors]: Thank you for engaging in an in-depth discussion with us during the rebuttal period!

We just want to point out an interesting observation that we think gives some evidence against this point. In our experiments, the best-performing text representation was, in fact, PGN, which does not describe the board state nor locations of pieces (as in the other representations), but instead records a trajectory of moves from the start of the game. As an example, here’s the **PGN for the board in Fig. 2**: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 $\cdots \cdots \cdots$ 27. Ke3 Qf3#. This representation is **harder than just getting the current board state** (as in ANL and image representations) as it must do state-tracking to infer the current position. This gives an example of how a more-explicit representation of the current board state, which seems intuitively easy to us, is not always the easiest for these models.

## **re: usefulness for practitioners**

Thank you for this suggestion! We will add to our paper an in-depth discussion on the usefulness of IsoBench for practitioners. We share a curtailed version below.

Regarding the graphs, there are many natural cases where a practitioner (e.g., a data scientist) starts with a symbolic (tabular) representation, and then may find it natural to convert it to a visual plot. In these cases, they have a choice of which representation to feed to the model, and our results tell them which is likely to be superior.

Similarly, for finance users who need to work with Markov Chains – even though visualization as chains/graphs are more interpretable to humans – our results tell them it’s better to provide LLMs with transition matrices of the Markov Chains instead of their graphical visualizations. 

## **re: no experts can write accurate text representations**

We agree that there are tasks that are more naturally grounded in image than text, e.g. the case of analyzing scientific plots presented in papers. Our math tasks are deliberately designed to assess necessary properties for analysis automation, such as counting, curvature, and symmetry. The models’ inability to reliably perform on these tasks serves as a cautionary tale to warn practitioners from overtrusting VLMs to carry out these analyses without expert insight.

## **re: same model for image captioning**

If an expert themselves is using the LLM to help automate tasks, they could add text descriptions as needed. It's valuable for them to know that this is likely to be helpful.

On the curious case of the effectiveness of IsoSP, our hypothesis is that VLMs are better at *perceiving* than *reasoning* with visual modalities. High-quality, textual reasoning dataset are abundant (e.g. [1]), but their VL counterparts (e.g. [2]) are scarce. Thus, reasoning with imperfect captions may outperform reasoning with complete visual input, due to the lack of quality training for VL reasoning. We aim to investigate this hypothesis in future works.

[Authors]: Dear Reviewer tTvn,

Thank you for your engagement! We’d like to clarify that **we have not claimed a causal effect between LoRA and fairness in any part of the paper**. We hope to emphasize an important distinction between

1. Motivating the study of fairness because we hypothesized a causal effect, vs;

2. Motivating the study because fairness is not explored in the past and that there are connections to prior work that hints at a potential correlation to fairness. Again, we simply do not know if there is such a correlation (much less causation, as the reviewer is suggesting), and hence our study to find out. 

**It appears that the reviewer has been characterizing our work as (1), when our work is more of (2)**, as explained in Section 1 (intro) and our earlier response above. 

We hope that our study will be helpful for many researchers who may have different opinions on whether LoRA may have an unintended impact on fairness. Our goal is to provide experimental support so that interested researchers can use this study to either confirm or adjust their beliefs, as opposed to relying on *prior opinions* without evidence. 

We nevertheless acknowledge that it is the authors’ responsibility to make the above points clear and we hope to improve our presentation in the updated version.
